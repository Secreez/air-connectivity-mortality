  abstract = {Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 103 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50\% of the expected annual mortality (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) or above 400 excess deaths per 100,000 population (Peru, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia). At the same time, in several other countries (e.g. Australia and New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-COVID infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their COVID-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), by up to two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan). Our results highlight the importance of open and rapid all-cause mortality reporting for pandemic monitoring.},

  abstract = {Due to the coronavirus global crisis, most countries have put in place restrictive measures in order to confine the pandemia and contain the number of casualties. Among the restrictive measures, air traffic suspension is certainly quite effective in reducing the mobility on the global scale in the short term but it also has high socio-economic impact on the long and short term. The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the aviation sector. Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019, a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to these hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41–1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25–30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66–1.98% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban. We hope that these preliminary results may be of help for informed policy making design of exit strategies from this global crisis.}

abstract = {The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in airline history, with irregular flight bans, the inability for accurate demand estimation, several turns in the epidemiological evolution, and a wide range of downstream effects on all aviation stakeholders. While most airlines have increasingly entered a recovery stage, compared to the utmost disruption around April 2020, the airline business is far from back-to-normality. Throughout the past two years, recurrent statements have been made regarding the existence of so-called ghost flights, where airlines operate nearly empty aircraft on markets with insufficient demand, partially with the aim to avoid losing precious airport slots. This study investigates the extent of such abnormal market service during the COVID-19 pandemic through an explorative, data-driven analysis, based on actual load factor data of European airlines for the years 2017 to 2021. We break down the observed deviations by airlines, markets, and airports. We find that low-cost carriers are most-likely to have performed abnormal flights during the pandemic; and that abnormal flights have mostly occurred on frequently-served markets. In addition, we show that airline responses, in terms of departure and yield changes, are largely heterogeneous across the 24 airlines in this study. Our study is the first one to shed light on the important issue of load factor deviations, and we hope that our findings can contribute to a better understanding of the existence of abnormal flights during the pandemic, as well as deriving appropriate policies for dealing with the ubiquitous threat and impact of ghost flights in the future.}

abstract = {Background
Public transportation is a major facilitator of the spread of infectious diseases and has been a focus of policy interventions aiming to suppress the current COVID-19 epidemic.
Methods
We use a random-effects panel data model and a Difference-in-Differences in Reverse (DDR) model to examine how air and rail transport links with Wuhan as well as the suspension of these transport links influenced the development of the epidemic in China.
Results
We find high-speed rail (HSR) and air connectivity with Wuhan resulted in 25.4% and 21.2% increases in the average number of daily new confirmed cases, respectively, while their suspension led to 18.6% and 13.3% decreases in that number. We also find that the suspension effect was dynamic, growing stronger over time and peaking 20–23 days after the Wuhan lockdown, then gradually wearing off. It took approximately four weeks for this effect to fully materialize, roughly twice the maximum incubation period, and similar dynamic patterns were seen in both HSR and air models. Overall, HSR had a greater impact on COVID-19 development than air transport.
Conclusions
Our research provides important evidence for implementing transportation-related policies in controlling future infectious diseases.}
