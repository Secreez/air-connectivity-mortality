**Feedback Proposal (March 27): Key Changes to the Original Plan**

1. **Removal of the SIR Model**  
   - *Originally*: An ODE-based SIR approach (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) was planned to simulate infection dynamics within a global mobility network.  
   - *Now*: No dynamic infection model. Instead, a **direct, static analysis** of flight connections (December 2019 / March 2020) compared to excess mortality data—without time-dependent transmission equations.

2. **Shift from Epidemic Simulation to Network Metrics**  
   - *Originally*: Nodes = airports, edges = passenger flows, updated daily using infection logic.  
   - *Now*: Nodes = countries (aggregated), edges = number or rank of flights from China to each European country. The model is **non-iterative**, focusing solely on **static snapshots** of the air traffic network.

3. **Method: From Simulation to Correlation**  
   - *Originally*: Detailed modeling of infection progression over time, including parameter calibration and infection thresholds.  
   - *Now*: **Spearman’s rank correlation** between (China–Europe flight ranks) and (excess mortality) at multiple time points: May 5, 2020; 2021; 2022; and 2023.

4. **Data Sources & Emphasis**  
   - *Originally*: Similar datasets, mainly used to parameterize a dynamic model.  
   - *Now*: Focus on Eurocontrol flight data (Dec 2019 & Mar 2020), and **WHO-based excess mortality** estimates. The Economist model is deliberately avoided due to concerns about methodological reliability.

5. **Interpretation & Scope**  
   - *Originally*: Potential conclusions on transmission rates, R-values, and epidemic timelines.  
   - *Now*: A strictly **exploratory correlation analysis**: “Did countries with stronger early air connections to China experience higher excess mortality later on?”  
   - **No** causal claims (“correlation ≠ causation”). Methods include Spearman’s rank correlation, **Sankey-style network maps**, and **multi-panel visualizations**.

6. **Impact on the Proposal**  
   - The **introduction, motivation, and data considerations remain valid**.  
   - The **methods section** needs to be reworked to reflect a "network + correlation" approach rather than a dynamic SIR model.  
   - The **timeline remains feasible**, with no need for simulation code but new tasks related to data aggregation and visualization.
   
Basically: "Exploratory data analysis can never be the whole story, but nothing else can serve as the foundation stone." - John W. Tukey
