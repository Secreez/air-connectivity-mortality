# Bachelor Thesis Proposal - Information

**Submitted:** 27 March 2025  
**Author:** Maximilian Elixhauser  
**Supervisor:** Christian Neuwirth

This folder contains the **original version** of the Bachelor thesis proposal as submitted on **27.03.2025**.  
It includes detailed planning, background research, and an early SIR-based modeling approach that has since been modified.

## Important Notes

- The methodological approach has changed significantly after supervisor feedback.  
- The new plan replaces the original SIR epidemic model with a **network-based, exploratory correlation analysis**.

See the file [`feedback_27_03.qmd`](feedback_27_03.qmd) for a detailed summary of the changes.

## What still applies

- Motivation, background literature, and data sources remain valid.
- Several sections (e.g., Introduction, Context, Data) can still be reused or adapted in the final thesis.

## Next Steps

Focus now shifts to the main thesis file (`thesis.qmd`).  
This proposal folder is kept for documentation and future reference.
