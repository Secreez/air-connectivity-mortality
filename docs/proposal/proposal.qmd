## Introduction

In January 2020, a single infected traveler on a long-haul flight could spark an outbreak thousands of kilometers away—turning global aviation into a high-speed conveyor belt for COVID-19 Indeed, early analyses demonstrated that aviation can rapidly reduce effective distances between cities, accelerating worldwide transmission [@chinazzi2020; @sun2022_a]. At the same time, countries exhibited **large variability in excess mortality**, often shaped by **demographic** (e.g., population age, life expectancy) and **economic** (e.g., GDP, healthcare capacity) factors. For instance, [@rahmanian2024] identified government effectiveness, vaccination coverage, and population age structure as key drivers of cross-national differences in pandemic mortality across 21 countries. Similarly, [@matveeva2023] noted that lower GDP per capita and slower vaccination rates were correlated with higher excess mortality among European nations, reflecting a synergistic effect of vaccination coverage and broader healthcare resources on reducing COVID-19–associated deaths.

A less investigated aspect, however, is **epidemic arrival time**: Did countries “hit first” by the virus—when non-pharmaceutical interventions were still immature—face worse overall mortality outcomes? This project aims to explore how early seeding of COVID-19 might have compounded the effects of the aforementioned demographic and economic predictors, ultimately shaping cross-national excess mortality patterns.

As outlined in the Z_GIS Thesis Blog by [@neuwirth2024], the **hypothesis** states that **locations hit early and unprepared** faced more severe outbreaks, characterized by:

- **Longer durations** without access to vaccination  
- **Lack of effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)** during early waves  
- **Additional outbreak risks** (e.g., secondary winter waves before vaccination was available)  

Accordingly, **early epidemic arrival** is expected to correlate with **higher prevalence, reproduction rates, and excess mortality** at the national level.  

To test this hypothesis, the initial approach suggested by [@neuwirth2024] (which I will evaluate and refine in subsequent sections) followed five key steps:

1. **Construct a Global Mobility Network (GMN)** using worldwide air travel data from early 2020 (**OpenSky COVID-19 Flight Dataset and/or FlightRadar24 API**) to represent the situation at the outbreak’s onset.  
2. **Implement a SIR network simulation model** as presented by [@brockmann2013].  
3. **Run outbreak simulations** (seeding in Wuhan) to estimate **arrival times (ranks)** of the epidemic in different regions.  
4. **Validate the model** by comparing simulated epidemic
5. **Correlate modeled epidemic arrivals with reported excess mortality**, assessing the impact of arrival timing on overall mortality outcomes.  


## Data Feasibility and Coverage

**However, upon closer examination, several feasibility and data coverage challenges arise.** While the original outline provides a structured approach, key limitations emerge regarding **data accessibility, modeling assumptions, and the practical constraints of flight tracking sources.** These factors impact the accuracy of epidemic arrival estimates and necessitate refinements in proposed methodology.

### Crowdsourced ADS-B: Strengths and Weaknesses

Multiple studies have leveraged **crowdsourced ADS-B data** for COVID-19 mobility analyses [@suzumura2020; @iacus2020; @salgas2024], yet coverage remains heavily biased toward North America and Europe. For instance, @suzumura2020 analyzed ~1.9 million flights (1 January–30 April 2020) from OpenSky’s dataset but noted minimal representation of flights into or out of China. By contrast, @strohmeier2021 reports that OpenSky recorded **30,989,481** flights in 2019—roughly **45%** of all global flights that year—still undercounting major regions such as China, Africa, and parts of Asia. Consequently, reconstructing **Wuhan**-based travel for early 2020 remains particularly challenging:

> *“OpenSky Network [...] does not provide global coverage and [...] flight data for major global airports such as the Beijing Capital International Airport in China and the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Indonesia are not available.”* [@iacus2020]

Such large discrepancies between partial flight samples (@suzumura2020 early 2020 subset) and near-full annual coverage (@strohmeier2021 2019 totals) underscore the network’s highly **uneven** global sensor distribution. While some countries enjoy excellent receiver density, enabling robust analysis, large swaths of Asia and Africa have insufficient coverage. This unevenness must be accounted for in any study that relies on ADS-B data for measuring pandemic-related changes in global air travel. Alternatives mentioned below may help to mitigate these gaps, either by incorporating proprietary datasets (OAG/IATA), leveraging regional traffic records, or exploring hybrid machine-learning approaches using open data.  

*Given these coverage biases, researchers often look beyond crowdsourced ADS-B to fill critical data gaps, as discussed next.*

### Proprietary Data and Regional Sources

An alternative to crowdsourced ADS-B data is **FlightRadar24** (FR24) platform as named in @neuwirth2024, which has been used extensively for aviation research. For instance, @quadros2022 compiled **global civil aviation emissions** estimates from **2017 to 2020** using FR24’s commercial ADS-B and multilateration network, producing a granular view of real-world flights—including unscheduled and cargo operations not always captured by schedule-only datasets. Their study demonstrated how **FR24 data** can capture a wider variety of flights than traditional sources (e.g., OAG), thus yielding **sometimes higher total flight counts** and **more comprehensive coverage** of different aircraft types.

However, @quadros2022 also noted that coverage can still be **uneven** in some regions (e.g., Asia, Africa), especially **earlier** in the dataset (pre-2020). Moreover, they highlight that FR24 data is **proprietary**, and large-scale retrieval of flight positions across multiple years involves **significant data-processing**. These points align with the cost structure observed in the **FlightRadar24 API** model, which relies on a **subscription-based, credit-driven** approach:

> - **Essential tier** costs $90 month, provides 333,000 monthly credits, and grants 2 years of historical availability.  
> - **Advanced tier** costs $900 month, offers 4,050,000 credits, and includes unlimited history (subject to system constraints).

Finally, **comprehensive commercial datasets** such as **OAG** or **IATA** provide near-complete flight schedules and passenger flows but remain **subscription-based** and **not freely accessible**. For instance, @chinazzi2020 rely on these sources for global airline data—demonstrating that researchers **often license** proprietary databases when modeling large-scale mobility. As a result, many projects turn to **regional** data providers—like **Eurocontrol** (Europe) or **FAA** (US)—which, despite filling some gaps, rarely yield a truly **global** connectivity picture and typically offer **aggregated** rather than flight-by-flight records.

Meanwhile, each **historic flight-position query** in a credit-based API (e.g., FlightRadar24) consumes credits according to the **number of flights returned**, so a **global** analysis (e.g., a worldwide GMN) could easily top **millions** of credits. Although **limit parameters** (bounding boxes) can reduce immediate costs, **systematic** coverage across multiple months remains **financially prohibitive** for many researchers. @quadros2022 show that **even partial** reliance on a commercial ADS-B platform (FR24) can be extremely resource-intensive for large-scale or historical analyses. @iacus2020 similarly underscore coverage challenges when working with commercial flight data—though they do not directly address cost—and note that partial or region-specific datasets often impose analytic limitations. Although @salgas2024 proposes an **open-data** workaround (Wikipedia plus XGBoost), the **labor overhead** and **data wrangling** remain substantial. Ultimately, **credit-based subscription models** may defer but do not **reduce** total expenses, forcing **smaller** or **unfunded** projects to adopt **regional** or **partial** approaches.

### ADS-B Exchange Archives

**ADS-B Exchange** offers **detailed 5-second interval** data globally from March 2020 onward—an improvement in coverage yet still incomplete for mainland China [@salgas2024]. Although this repository enables advanced analyses (e.g., trajectory-level reconstructions), it may not capture critical early-2020 flights from Wuhan, limiting its utility for certain pandemic-related research questions.

[+ Add the pull problem here]

*Hence, while ADS-B Exchange provides richer detail in some regions and time frames, its post-March 2020 coverage could hamper studies of the pandemic’s earliest phase.*

### A Different Approach: Wikipedia + XGBoost {#wikipedia-xgboost} [check precision and relevance!]

A novel method proposed by [@salgas2024] illustrates how **Wikipedia-scraped airport routes** can merge with **XGBoost-based seat-capacity estimations** to fill gaps in open aviation datasets. Although @salgas2024 focused on **2019** traffic, the same principle could apply based on my understanding to **early 2020**—provided historical Wikipedia snapshots (e.g., via Internet Archive) are accessible. By training a regressor on routes where coverage is reasonably known (OpenSky or Eurocontrol), one can **impute** missing flights—including potentially those out of Wuhan—thereby extending **GMN** coverage for the outbreak’s initial phase.

However, as @salgas2024 emphasize, building a global flight network by merging **multiple open sources**, then **training** a seat-capacity estimator is **labor-intensive**—involving extensive data cleanup, database validation, and iterative scaling. The authors note that, although the approach achieves near-global coverage, it requires *manually parsing* Wikipedia, reconciling partial radar or administrative records, and repeatedly fine-tuning estimates with regression-based gap-filling—steps that can be “long and complex” to maintain for different years. They further stress that the **dataset’s accuracy is limited** at the **route level** and is primarily intended for **aggregated** analyses at the country or continental scale. As a result, for a **bachelor’s thesis** with limited hours (e.g., ~300), the **full pipeline** of Wikipedia crawling + XGBoost might be **overly ambitious**, especially if combined with an SIR model and mortality correlational work. Still, for researchers needing comprehensive open-data coverage—and willing to handle significant data wrangling—this method remains a **unique** open-source solution for bridging flight-network gaps, which could be adapted to the early-2020 context.

*Therefore, while the Wikipedia + XGBoost approach is innovative, its high labor overhead may exceed the scope of a short-term research project.*

### Seats vs. Actual Passengers

Because most **open flight datasets** (e.g., OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange) and even official schedules **lack passenger load factors** or manifests, **researchers in the past usually approximated** the number of travelers by **multiplying seat capacity by an assumed occupancy**. 

Pre-pandemic, global passenger load factors (PLF) reached a record 82.6% in 2019, according to IATA [@IATA2020]. However, the COVID-19 crisis led to a sharp decline to 65.2% in 2020 [@Statista2024], marking the steepest year-over-year drop in aviation history. Applying these or similar assumptions when estimating passenger flows can still lead to several potential inaccuracies:

- **Cargo vs. Passenger Flights.** ADS-B data typically do **not** label cargo-only flights, which might appear as “seats”. If not filtered out by airline or aircraft type, cargo operations can be **mistakenly counted** as carrying travelers, inflating estimates [@suzumura2020]. 
- **Reduced Occupancy and Ghost Flights.** During COVID-19, many flights operated with extremely low passenger loads (so-called "ghost flights"), often to maintain airport slot rights or for crew recertification [@sun2022_b]. These flights challenge standard seat-capacity methods, as using pre-pandemic load factors could significantly overestimate actual mobility. While industry-wide load factors reflect averages, individual routes often had near-empty flights, complicating large-scale modeling.

*In practice, this “seat capacity × load factor” approximation remains the most feasible for large-scale modeling—though it risks both under- and overestimation of true passenger volumes.*

Accordingly, in our model, we will estimate passenger flows by multiplying seat capacity by a load factor, despite acknowledging the margin of error introduced by ghost flights and untracked cargo operations.

### Are Passengers “Isolated” in Transit? How does this affect the model?

In large-scale **SIR** network models @brockmann2013, each flight is simply an **edge** linking an origin to a destination; the hours spent onboard collapse therefore into a brief “travel step” and infected travelers may introduce new cases at their destination.

- **No in-flight quarantine modeling.** Globally, it is not assumed that passengers remain isolated onboard; they are effectively free to transmit infection upon arrival or connections.  
- **In-cabin spread.** While **computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies** suggest that **virus transmission within aircraft cabins** depends on factors like seat configuration, airflow patterns, and flight duration [@wang2023], these details lie **outside** typical macro-level SIR simulations. Large-scale epidemiological models generally **collapse** transit events into a **single travel step** without modeling intra-cabin spread.

Hence, in a **network contagion** view, flights function as **routes** that let infections jump across distant nodes; whether passengers continue traveling onward or remain in-country is rarely distinguished. While practical, this simplification can overlook nuances such as near-empty flights or onboard restrictions, but remains standard in pandemic models due to data limitations.

*In sum, large-scale SIR models typically focus on inter-node transmission, treating in-flight events as a single jump rather than a site of active spread.*

## Rationale and Potential Approaches for Future Research

### Regional vs. Global Scope

Owing to open-data limitations, one option is to **narrow** the project scope to a region with better coverage (e.g., **Europe**) [@suzumura2020; @iacus2020]. Even a Europe-centric GMN could test the early-arrival hypothesis among multiple countries. Conversely, an **approximate** global network might accept substantial data gaps—particularly in Asia—or employ **Wikipedia + XGBoost** to fill known voids [@salgas2024]. Either path allows for constructing at least a partial flight network to assess epidemic arrival times.

Importantly, spatial contagion also occurs within countries. As shown by [@laroze2020], intra-country commuter flows—in their case, between English local authority districts—can substantially influence how quickly an infection travels after an initial seeding event. This underscores that a regional approach to modeling should account not only for international flights but also for domestic or subregional connectivity, especially if multiple lockdown phases or mobility restrictions are introduced.

Consequently, this thesis will adopt a Europe-centric approach, where data coverage is denser and more consistently available via Eurocontrol. This targeted scope helps mitigate the coverage gaps and high subscription costs associated with global-scale flight data.

The next section details how we will integrate European flight data sources, such as Eurocontrol, into a network-based SIR model, and subsequently correlate early arrival ranks with excess mortality metrics.

### SIR as a Model Implementation

@chinazzi2020 demonstrated that, following Wuhan’s travel ban on 23 January 2020, major airports like Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen took on a significantly larger role in exporting cases internationally. Therefore, if direct Wuhan flight data are missing, these alternative hubs can serve as a proxy to capture the majority of early seeding events. Thus, we approximate initial seeding from these alternate airports to capture the bulk of inbound flights. The resulting predicted first-case arrivals can be compared against reported seeding events, aligning with studies that highlight the role of population movement in virus transmission [@lai2020].

For a more detailed incubation-lag analysis, one could adopt an **SEIR** framework (or its multi-stage variant, **SEnIR**) that more accurately captures a **Gamma-like** incubation-time distribution [@abou2020]. Indeed, [@rozan2024] show that using a realistic (non-exponential) distribution for the exposed period can substantially change predictions about epidemic peaks, timing, and overall infection counts. While these approaches yield more nuanced results, they require additional parameters (e.g., number of subcompartments, shape parameters for the Gamma distribution) and more extensive calibration, as well as more complex agent-based simulations if applied at the individual level [@rozan2024]. **@brockmann2013 justify a simpler, mean-rate SIR formulation for influenza-like diseases, noting that a single average recovery parameter (i.e., $B^-1$ in their depiction of influenza-like diseases often captures core dynamics sufficiently.** Given the scope of this bachelor thesis, the simpler **SIR** model may suffice to approximate arrival times, but future work could incorporate the **SEnIR** approach for a more robust treatment of incubation periods.

## Specified Data

Many providers of flight movement data (e.g., FR24, OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange) rely heavily on **crowdsourced ADS-B** signals, leading to uneven coverage and potential biases in areas with fewer ADS-B receivers. By contrast, **Eurocontrol** obtains **flight plans and updates for all IFR** (Instrument Flight Rules) flights in European airspace, merging them with radar and other ANSP sources to create a more centralized, **operational** picture of traffic.

### Access & Terms of Service

- Eurocontrol offers an **R&D Platform** for non-commercial, research-focused work—requiring **registration** and acceptance of their Terms of Service (TOS).  
- Users **cannot share** the raw ATM Dataset publicly, but may publish **aggregated** or **derived** results (e.g., charts, Sankey diagrams) as long as Eurocontrol is properly **acknowledged**.  
- I have received **personal access** to this dataset for this bachelor’s thesis, strictly for **research** activities.

### Data Availability & Format

- **Four sample months per year**: March, June, September, December.  
- **Commercial flights only** (flight type `S` (scheduled) or `N` (non-scheduled fligt)), excluding general aviation and military.  
- **Flight-level details**: Schedules, actual off-block/landing times, aircraft type (ICAO 8643), operator (ICAO 8585), route segments (waypoints), and relevant airspace data (updated each AIRAC cycle).  
- Because coverage is **limited** to four months annually, additional periods must be approximated—**OpenSky** or other data sources may supplement missing routes or months.

**Metadata & TOS**: See [EUROCONTROL ATM R&D Datasets – Terms of Use](https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/eurocontrol-atm-rd-datasets-terms-use) for further details on licensing and data fields. All usage here adheres to **non-commercial** research and disallows distribution of raw data.


### Combining with OpenSky  
To fill temporal or regional gaps outside the four Eurocontrol months, this thesis will also leverage **OpenSky** crowdsourced ADS-B data, more specifically, "Crowdsourced air traffic data from The OpenSky Network 2020" from @olive2023. While OpenSky may have coverage limitations, especially in certain parts of Asia or Africa, its **continuous** temporal availability complements the **Eurocontrol** snapshot months—thereby constructing a Eurocontrol Membered dataset for the SIR modeling.



### Modeling Europe’s Initial Wave and Time Windows

While **sporadic** COVID-19 cases may have circulated in Europe as early as **December 2019**, retrospective analyses suggest that **SARS-CoV-2 was present in France before its official recognition** (Deslandes et al., 2020). Epidemiological models further indicate that **major seeding** likely occurred between **January and February 2020**, primarily through **air travel from China** (@chinazzi2020). 

However, **gradual travel restrictions** were implemented as the outbreak progressed:

- **January 23, 2020:** Wuhan imposed an **internal lockdown**, yet **international travel continued**, allowing undetected carriers to reach global hubs (SOURCE).  

- **Late January–Early February 2020:** Multiple countries, including the **U.S. and Australia**, introduced **travel bans for direct flights** from China, but **indirect routes via major transit hubs remained open** (SOURCE!). 

- **March 2020:** As cases surged, **Europe-wide lockdowns** drastically reduced flight volumes (SOURCE!), but by this point, **initial seeding had already taken place** (SOURCE!).  

Since **Eurocontrol flight data** is only available for **fixed quarterly months**, this thesis integrates **two complementary datasets** to capture both pre-seeding and early-lockdown dynamics:  

- **OpenSky (January–February, April–May 2020):**  
   - Provides **continuous ADS-B coverage** of inbound flights, though **China data is limited**.  
   - Useful for identifying **early transmission pathways via indirect transit hubs**.  
   - Tracks **air mobility changes** as lockdowns progressed.  

- **Eurocontrol (March & June 2020):**  
   - March dataset offers a **complete IFR snapshot** just as lockdowns began.  
   - June dataset allows for **comparison with post-lockdown trends** to assess mitigation effects.  

### Excess Mortality Correlation

After estimating arrival times per country, these values will be correlated with **excess mortality** and key socioeconomic indicators—**GDP, median age, and healthcare quality**—to evaluate whether **early seeding systematically increased mortality after adjusting for confounders** (Sun et al., 2022; Chinazzi et al., 2020).  

A **recent short communication** (Neuwirth et al., in preparation) compiles **excess mortality data from x countries**, providing a robust empirical foundation for such an analysis. Therefore, even a **Europe-focused study** can yield valuable insights into how **early arrival shaped national outcomes**, contributing to a broader understanding of pandemic dynamics.  

## Advanced Research Question & Hypothesis

**Research Question**  
> Does the timing of epidemic seeding—derived from integrated air traffic data (OpenSky for January–February and April–May, and Eurocontrol for March and June 2020)—correlate with higher excess mortality in Europe during the first wave, even after accounting for key socioeconomic factors?

**Hypothesis**  
We hypothesize that **countries experiencing earlier epidemic seeding**, as inferred from our integrated flight network analysis over January–June 2020, will exhibit **higher first-wave excess mortality**. This association is expected to persist even after controlling for critical socioeconomic factors such as GDP, UHC, and median age. We anticipate that this relationship is driven by:

- **Shorter reaction times for interventions:**  
  Countries seeded earlier had less time to implement effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), allowing for more rapid viral spread.

- **Overwhelmed healthcare systems:**  
  Regions with limited healthcare capacity experienced early surges that strained resources, contributing to elevated mortality.

- **Higher risk exposure in densely connected transit hubs:**  
  Major airports (e.g., Frankfurt, Paris, London) serve as critical nodes with high passenger volumes. The greater the number of inbound flights, the higher the likelihood of rapid epidemic seeding and subsequent spread. Our integrated approach, combining continuous OpenSky data and Eurocontrol snapshots, will capture these dynamics over the early pandemic period.


## Data Feasibility and Coverage

(see above)

## Research Design and Methodology

Following the data feasibility evaluation and in alignment with my **Supervisor’s advice (March 14, 2025)**, I will **avoid** complex agent-based modeling (ABM) in which individual passenger routes and return journeys are explicitly tracked. Instead, I will **focus on a streamlined network-based SIR model**, akin to [@brockmann2013], for the following reasons:

- **Feasibility**: ABM introduces excessive complexity for real-world flight data—beyond the scope and timeline of a bachelor’s thesis.  
- **Aggregated Flows**: Representing airports (or countries) as **nodes** with passenger flows (seat capacity × load factor) as **edges** keeps the model tractable.  
- **Core Dynamics Preserved**: Even without individual-level detail, this approach maintains the main elements needed to study **early seeding** and **excess mortality** correlations.

### Specific Steps

1. **Construct a Europe-Centric Global Mobility Network (GMN)**
   - Include as many European airports as **data availability** allows (using datasets such as OpenSky, Eurocontrol, and ICAO sources).
   - If coverage or time constraints require a subset, **prioritize major hubs** (e.g., Paris, London, Frankfurt) that capture the bulk of passenger traffic.
   - Represent edges as **aggregated daily passenger flows** based on seat capacity × load factor.
   - **Visualization Note:** Detailed airport-level networks (e.g., via a Sankey diagram) will be created to illustrate the complex flight flows; however, for the regression analysis, these flows will be aggregated at the **country level**.


2. **Implement an ODE-Based SIR Framework**  
   - Use **standard** SIR compartments: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R).
   - Model each airport as a **node** with daily updates via differential equations.
   - For seeding, rather than relying solely on data from Wuhan, the model will incorporate inbound flight data from a range of Chinese airports. This strategy is particularly justified given Wuhan’s role as a critical transportation hub—its extensive internal connectivity facilitates rapid movement across China @zhang2020.
     - This approach is justified by [@chinazzi2020], who demonstrated that after Wuhan’s travel ban on 23 January 2020, airports such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen significantly contributed to international case exportation.
     - Thus, by using the earliest available inbound flight data from these hubs, we approximate the initial seeding events that likely occurred in January–February 2020.
   - If direct data is sparse for any specific airport, arrival points may be approximated using alternative methods.

3. **Determine “Arrival Times” for Each Node**  
   - Define **arrival time** as the simulation day when an airport’s infected fraction exceeds a small threshold (e.g., 1 or 5 infected individuals).  
   - **Aggregate node-level arrival times to the country level**—either by taking the earliest arrival among all airports in a country or by computing a weighted average based on passenger volumes.

4. **Rank Countries by Their Estimated Arrival Time**  
   - Sort countries from earliest to latest based on the aggregated arrival times. This ranking will capture **how quickly** an epidemic seeds each location.

5. **Correlate Modeled Arrival Times with Excess Mortality & Socioeconomic Indicators**  
   - At the country level, compare the estimated arrival ranks with data on **excess mortality**, GDP, healthcare capacity (e.g., measured via the UHC Coverage Index), and median age.  
   - Evaluate whether earlier seeding correlates with higher mortality, even after controlling for these confounding factors.  
   - Note that factors such as vaccination rates are not included in this analysis, as the focus is on the early phase of the pandemic.

- Maybe need to dtone it down a bit.. but shwocase. that Wuhan solely is NOT the right way to go.
