# Evaluation of Proposed Hypothesis and Research Outline

**COVID-19** is the first pandemic extensively documented through digital flight and mobility tracking, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study how **air travel** drives pathogen spread. Indeed, early analyses demonstrated that aviation can rapidly reduce effective distances between cities, accelerating worldwide transmission [@chinazzi2020; @sun2022]. At the same time, countries exhibited **large variability in excess mortality**, often shaped by **demographic** (e.g., population age, life expectancy) and **economic** (e.g., GDP, healthcare capacity) factors. For instance, [@rahmanian2024] identified government effectiveness, vaccination coverage, and population age structure as key drivers of cross-national differences in pandemic mortality across 21 countries. Similarly, [@matveeva2023] noted that lower GDP per capita and slower vaccination rates were correlated with higher excess mortality among European nations, reflecting a synergistic effect of vaccination coverage and broader healthcare resources on reducing COVID-19–associated deaths.

A less investigated aspect, however, is **epidemic arrival time**: Did countries “hit first” by the virus—when non-pharmaceutical interventions were still immature—face worse overall mortality outcomes? This project aims to explore how early seeding of COVID-19 might have compounded the effects of the aforementioned demographic and economic predictors, ultimately shaping cross-national excess mortality patterns.

As outlined in the Z_GIS Thesis Blog by [@neuwirth2024], the **hypothesis** states that **locations hit early and unprepared** faced more severe outbreaks, characterized by:

- **Longer durations** without access to vaccination  
- **Lack of effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)** during early waves  
- **Additional outbreak risks** (e.g., secondary winter waves before vaccination was available)  

Accordingly, **early epidemic arrival** is expected to correlate with **higher prevalence, reproduction rates, and excess mortality** at the national level.  

To test this hypothesis, the proposed approach follows five key steps:  

1. **Construct a Global Mobility Network (GMN)** using worldwide air travel data from early 2020 (**OpenSky COVID-19 Flight Dataset and/or FlightRadar24 API**) to represent the situation at the outbreak’s onset.  
2. **Implement a SIR network simulation model** as presented by [@brockmann2013].  
3. **Run outbreak simulations** (seeding in Wuhan) to estimate **arrival times (ranks)** of the epidemic in different regions.  
4. **Validate the model** by comparing simulated epidemic arrival times with reported first-case data.  
5. **Correlate modeled epidemic arrivals with reported excess mortality**, assessing the impact of arrival timing on overall mortality outcomes.  

## Feasibility and Data Coverage Issues

**However, upon closer examination, several feasibility and data coverage challenges arise.** While the original outline provides a structured approach, key limitations emerge regarding **data accessibility, modeling assumptions, and the practical constraints of flight tracking sources.** These factors impact the accuracy of epidemic arrival estimates and necessitate refinements in methodology.  

### Crowdsourced ADS-B: Strengths and Weaknesses 

Multiple studies have leveraged **crowdsourced ADS-B data** for COVID-19 mobility analyses [@suzumura2020; @iacus2020; @salgas2024], yet coverage remains heavily biased toward North America and Europe. For instance, @suzumura2020 analyzed ~1.9 million flights (1 January–30 April 2020) from OpenSky’s dataset but noted minimal representation of flights into or out of China. By contrast, @strohmeier2021 reports that OpenSky recorded **30,989,481** flights in 2019—roughly **45%** of all global flights that year—still undercounting major regions such as China, Africa, and parts of Asia. Consequently, reconstructing **Wuhan**-based travel for early 2020 remains particularly challenging:

> *“OpenSky Network [...] does not provide global coverage and [...] flight data for major global airports such as the Beijing Capital International Airport in China and the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Indonesia are not available.”* [@iacus2020]

Such large discrepancies between partial flight samples (@suzumura2020 early 2020 subset) and near-full annual coverage (@strohmeier2021 2019 totals) underscore the network’s highly **uneven** global sensor distribution. While some countries enjoy excellent receiver density, enabling robust analysis, large swaths of Asia and Africa have insufficient coverage. This unevenness must be accounted for in any study that relies on ADS-B data for measuring pandemic-related changes in global air travel.

### Proprietary Data and Regional Sources (Check next!)

While **comprehensive commercial datasets** such as **OAG** or **IATA** provide near-complete flight schedules and passenger flows, they remain **expensive** and **not openly accessible** [@chinazzi2020]. As a result, researchers often rely on **regional** data sources, for instance **Eurocontrol** (Europe) or **FAA** (US), which—although they can fill certain coverage gaps—rarely yield a truly **global** connectivity picture, and often offer **aggregated** rather than flight-by-flight records.

In epidemiological work, scholars have also merged flight data with **local mobility datasets**. For example, @lai2020 used promising **Baidu** location-based services (LBS) in China to track daily intercity population movements alongside official flight data, concluding that **non-pharmaceutical interventions** (NPIs) like early detection and isolation outweighed the long-term benefits of travel restrictions. However, **Baidu** data remains **inaccessible** for most outside researchers because of licensing and privacy constraints, complicating attempts to replicate or extend such models internationally.

### ADS-B Exchange Archives

**ADS-B Exchange** offers **detailed 5-second interval** data globally from March 2020 onward—an improvement in coverage yet still incomplete for mainland China [@salgas2024]. Although this repository enables advanced analyses (e.g., trajectory-level reconstructions), it may not capture critical early-2020 flights from Wuhan, limiting its utility for certain pandemic-related research questions.

### A Different Approach: Wikipedia + XGBoost

A novel method proposed by [@salgas2024] illustrates how **Wikipedia-scraped airport routes** can merge with **XGBoost-based seat-capacity estimations** to fill gaps in open aviation datasets. Although @salgas2024 focused on **2019** traffic, the same principle could apply based on my understanding to **early 2020**—provided historical Wikipedia snapshots (e.g., via Internet Archive) are accessible. By training a regressor on routes where coverage is reasonably known (OpenSky or Eurocontrol), one can **impute** missing flights—including potentially those out of Wuhan—thereby extending **GMN** coverage for the outbreak’s initial phase.

However, as @salgas2024 emphasize, building a global flight network by merging **multiple open sources**, then **training** a seat-capacity estimator is **labor-intensive**—involving extensive data cleanup, database validation, and iterative scaling. The authors note that, although the approach achieves near-global coverage, it requires *manually parsing* Wikipedia, reconciling partial radar or administrative records, and repeatedly fine-tuning estimates with regression-based gap-filling—steps that can be “long and complex” to maintain for different years. They further stress that the **dataset’s accuracy is limited** at the **route level** and is primarily intended for **aggregated** analyses at the country or continental scale. As a result, for a **bachelor’s thesis** with limited hours (e.g., ~300), the **full pipeline** of Wikipedia crawling + XGBoost might be **overly ambitious**, especially if combined with an SIR model and mortality correlational work. Still, for researchers needing comprehensive open-data coverage—and willing to handle significant data wrangling—this method remains a **unique** open-source solution for bridging flight-network gaps, which could be adapted to the early-2020 context.

### Seats vs. Actual Passengers

Because most **open flight datasets** (e.g., OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange) and even official schedules **lack passenger load factors** or manifests, **researchers in the past usually approximated** the number of travelers by **multiplying seat capacity by an assumed occupancy**. 

Pre-pandemic, global passenger load factors (PLF) reached a record 82.6% in 2019, according to IATA [@IATA2020]. However, the COVID-19 crisis led to a sharp decline to 65.2% in 2020 [@Statista2024], marking the steepest year-over-year drop in aviation history. Applying these or similar assumptions when estimating passenger flows can still lead to several potential inaccuracies:

- **Cargo vs. Passenger Flights.** ADS-B data typically do **not** label cargo-only flights, which might appear as “seats”. If not filtered out by airline or aircraft type, cargo operations can be **mistakenly counted** as carrying travelers, inflating estimates [@suzumura2020]. 
- **Reduced Occupancy and Ghost Flights** During COVID-19, many flights operated with extremely low passenger loads (so-called "ghost flights"), often to maintain airport slot rights or for crew recertification [@sun2022_b]. These flights challenge standard seat-capacity methods, as using pre-pandemic load factors could significantly overestimate actual mobility. While industry-wide load factors reflect averages, individual routes often had near-empty flights, complicating large-scale modeling.
  
Despite these pitfalls, **seat-capacity $×$ load factor** remains the most feasible approach for open-source aviation data. More-sophisticated methods—such as merging flight data with partial booking stats, mobile-phone location data [@burrieza2022], or route-specific occupancy—are typically unavailable on a global scale. In practice, investigators often cross-validate seat-based estimates against airport traffic counts or official data where possible.

### Are Passengers “Isolated” in Transit?

In large-scale **SIR** network models @brockmann2013, each flight is simply an **edge** linking an origin to a destination; the hours spent onboard collapse therefore into a brief “travel step” and infected travelers may introduce new cases at their destination.

- **No in-flight quarantine modeling.** Globally, it is not assumed that passengers remain isolated onboard; they are effectively free to transmit infection upon arrival or connections.  
- **In-cabin spread.** While **computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies** suggest that **virus transmission within aircraft cabins** depends on factors like seat configuration, airflow patterns, and flight duration [@wang2023], these details lie **outside** typical macro-level SIR simulations. Large-scale epidemiological models generally **collapse** transit events into a **single travel step** without modeling intra-cabin spread. As a result, flights are **treated as links** between origin and destination nodes, assuming **infected passengers introduce cases only upon arrival** rather than modeling potential transmission during flights.

Hence, in a **network contagion** view, flights function as **routes** that let infections jump across distant nodes; whether passengers continue traveling onward or remain in-country is rarely distinguished. While practical, this simplification can overlook nuances such as near-empty flights or onboard restrictions, but remains standard in pandemic models due to data limitations.

## Rationale and Potential Approaches

### Regional vs. Global Scope

Owing to open-data limitations, one option is to **narrow** the project scope to a region with better coverage (e.g., **Europe**) [@suzumura2020; @iacus2020]. Even a Europe-centric GMN could test the early-arrival hypothesis among multiple countries. Conversely, an **approximate** global network might accept substantial data gaps—particularly in Asia—or employ **Wikipedia + XGBoost** to fill known voids [@salgas2024]. Either path allows for constructing at least a partial flight network to assess epidemic arrival times.

### SIR (or SEIR) Model Implementation

Following [@brockmann2013], a **network-based SIR** model can be used to estimate arrival times for each country/node, treating flight routes as edges along which the infection travels. If direct data on Wuhan flights is lacking, one might approximate initial seeding from other major Asian hubs (e.g., Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo) using ADS-B data. The resulting predicted first-case arrivals can be compared against reported seeding events, aligning with studies that highlight the role of population movement in virus transmission [@lai2020].

For a more detailed incubation-lag analysis, one could instead use an SEIR framework, as described by [@abou2020]. This model adds an Exposed (E) compartment for individuals who are infected but not yet infectious. This extra compartment accounts for incubation periods and can yield more realistic dynamics for diseases like COVID-19. However, it also adds complexity—more parameters to estimate and a lengthier calibration process. Given the scope of a bachelor’s thesis, the simpler SIR approach may suffice to derive approximate arrival times, but future work could adopt SEIR for a more detailed incubation-lag analysis.

### Excess Mortality Correlation

Finally, these **arrival-time estimates** can be matched with **excess mortality** and socioeconomic factors—like GDP, median age, vaccination rates, and healthcare quality—to assess whether **early arrival** persists as a significant predictor after accounting for other variables [@sun2022_a; @chinazzi2020]. A **recent short communication** (Neuwirth et al., in preparation) compiles 59 countries’ mortality and demographic data into a single dataset that could serve as the basis for such a correlation analysis. Even a region-specific approach (e.g., Europe-only) can yield valuable insights into the role of arrival timing in national outcomes.
