    "In December 2019 the direct CN/HK traffic into Europe was highly concentrated: Germany (DE), the United Kingdom (GB) and the Netherlands (NL) alone handled \\> 60 % of all arrivals, followed by France and Belgium as secondary hubs. Every other EUROCONTROL state received fewer than 300 flights that month. By March 2020 volumes collapsed everywhere (blue bars) yet the ranking hardly changed: the same three hubs still dominated, each retaining 30-50 % of their December traffic, while Italy, Turkey and Finland - already mid-tier in December - fell below 250 flights. Combining both months (green bars) therefore produces an extremely right-skewed distribution: the top two countries (DE, GB) each saw \\> 900 direct flights, four times as many as rank #4. Interpretation: epidemic “import pressure” from direct flights was not evenly spread across Europe; instead, a small group of Western European gateways bore the brunt of exposure in both the initial seeding phase (December 2019) and the onset of pandemic restrictions (March 2020), when coordinated lockdowns and border closures rapidly reduced international flight volumes.\n",

In total, 15 CN/HK airports fed London-Heathrow, 13 fed Paris-CDG and 12 fed Frankfurt between December 2019 and March 2020 (left panel, green bars). Every other EUROCONTROL destination received routes from ≤ 10 origins, and most from fewer than 6. The month-specific panel (right) reveals that this breadth of origins existed already in December (orange) and, despite the March collapse (blue), the major hubs still drew from 4-6 different airports while almost all secondary gateways fell to one or two. **Implication:** the first-wave seeding risk was amplified not just by sheer flight counts but by the variety of source cities funnelling into the same Western European hubs, increasing the chance of multiple independent introductions.\n",

    "-   **Near-universal contraction.** By late March 2020, every EUROCONTROL member with ≥ 5 direct CN/HK flights in December had cut at least half of them; **15 of 19 slashed \\> 90 %** (Figure @pct_change_filtered).\n",
    "-   **Import shut-off confirmed externally.** Independent industry data show that by **December 2020 China–Europe long-haul capacity was ≈ 7 % of 2019, while China’s domestic network had already rebounded to ≈ 93 %** of pre-crisis levels \\[@warnocksmith2021, Fig 6-7\\]. This echoes the post-April collapse in our combined-flights exposure index and illustrates how effectively Europe was sealed off from fresh seeding risk.\n",
    "-   **Policy timing.** The cliff-edge aligns with two synchronous border measures: (i) the EU/Schengen external-border stop of **17 March 2020** (@EU2020) and (ii) China’s **“Five-One” rule of 26 March 2020**, limiting each airline to one weekly CN–EU passenger rotation (@CAAC2020).\n",
    "-   **Subsidies couldn’t break the wall.** Even Beijing’s cash incentive of **≈ US\\$ 0.003–0.008 per ASK** for international sectors failed to coax carriers back onto Europe routes \\[@warnocksmith2021\\]. Fiscal sweeteners are powerless when cross-border health rules and quarantine mandates crush demand.\n",
    "-   **Hubs vs medium markets.** Major transfer states—UK, Germany, Netherlands—still operated a few hundred flights after a 50–70 % cut, whereas medium markets such as Italy, Austria and the Nordics dropped to single digits (or zero). Absolute residual volume, not percentage change, drives any continuing exposure.\n",
    "-   **Interpretation.** Percentage change captures the policy shock; the *Δ flights* column shows where residual seeding potential persisted. Down-stream mortality correlations therefore need to weight absolute exposure—and discount cargo-heavy hubs—when assessing import pressure.\n",

    "Note: ASK means airlines were paid roughly three-quarters of a cent for every seat-kilometre they kept in the China-Europe market—regardless of whether those seats were filled.\n",
