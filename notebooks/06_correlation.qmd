**Key patterns:**

* Early air connectivity explained a substantial share of cross-country variation in first-wave excess mortality (ρ ≈ 0.53, 95% CI \[0.18, 0.80], p < 0.01).
* From 2021 onwards, the rank correlation essentially disappeared; by 2022–23 it became modestly negative (ρ ≈ –0.45, 95% CI \[–0.79, 0.00]).
* This sign change exceeds the bootstrap confidence intervals, suggesting the shift is unlikely due to random sampling in a \~25-country dataset.
* Notably, **“Flights per million population” was already significantly negative from 2021 onward**, indicating that higher per-capita connectivity was linked to *lower* late-pandemic mortality—a possible “resource advantage” effect in highly connected countries.

**Interpretation:**

* International flights played a major role only during the initial seeding phase—before widespread community transmission in Europe.
* Once SARS-CoV-2 was established in most countries, *domestic factors*—population age, public health response, healthcare capacity, and vaccination coverage—became dominant in shaping excess mortality.
* This pattern aligns with studies showing that the effect of border controls diminishes once local transmission is established (see e.g., Chinazzi et al. 2020, *Science*).

**Why bootstrap CIs?**

* We computed 5,000 bootstrap resamples, following best practice for small-n correlation studies (DiCiccio & Efron 1996; Tong et al. 2016; Mokhtar 2023). This provides stable confidence intervals, and a fixed random seed (`set.seed(42)`) ensures full reproducibility.

**Summary:**
Early in the pandemic, countries most exposed to direct flights from China and Hong Kong suffered higher excess mortality. However, as the pandemic progressed, this association disappeared—and by 2022–2023, even reversed: high connectivity was linked to *lower* excess deaths, likely reflecting differences in domestic response, health system capacity, and perhaps a “rich country” advantage.
These findings underscore the narrow window during which travel restrictions can affect epidemic outcomes, and the overwhelming importance of internal factors once local transmission is widespread.

Take-away:

* **Early impact, short window:** Direct flight connectivity strongly correlates with excess mortality during the first pandemic wave, suggesting early import pressure was a key driver of cross-country variation.

* **Rapid attenuation:** This association disappears after 2020 and reverses by 2022–2023, reflecting a shift from international importation to domestic drivers such as demographics, public health response, and health system capacity.

* **Policy implication:** Border controls can slow initial seeding but have limited effect once local transmission is established. Long-term pandemic outcomes depend more on internal mitigation and health system resilience.

**Interpretation:**

Countries with the highest direct air connectivity to China and Hong Kong (such as Germany, the UK, France, and the Netherlands) experienced some of the highest excess mortality rates during the first wave of COVID-19. This positive rank correlation (ρ = 0.53) supports the hypothesis that early exposure via direct flights contributed significantly to cross-country differences in first-wave mortality. Outliers (e.g., Sweden, Ireland, Slovakia) may reflect unique domestic factors.

```

**Interpretation:**

* **Consistent moderate association:** In both December 2019 and March 2020, countries with more direct scheduled passenger flights from China and Hong Kong tended to have higher excess mortality by early May 2020. This relationship is reflected in moderate Spearman correlations (ρ ≈ 0.50–0.57).

* **Pattern driven by hubs and hardest-hit countries:** The association is strongest for major Western European air hubs—such as Spain, Italy, the UK, Belgium, France, and the Netherlands—which were among the first and worst affected in the pandemic’s initial wave.

* **Interpretation:** These results support the hypothesis that early international connectivity played a significant role in seeding the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 across Europe. However, not all highly connected countries suffered high mortality, and not all countries with high mortality were major hubs—indicating that factors beyond air traffic (e.g., timing of interventions, population age, health system readiness) also shaped outcomes.

* **Caveat:** The observed association diminishes in later periods as local transmission and domestic factors become the dominant determinants of excess mortality, which aligns with global findings that border controls have the most impact only before widespread community spread is established.

```

**Interpretation:**
* All three exposure metrics are clearly positive in 2020; in 2021 their CIs straddle zero, and from 2022 the combined metric is significantly negative, confirming a genuine sign-flip rather than sampling noise.

```

# Limitations

## Data limitations

- Flight counts are IFR plans, not passenger-weighted ...

## Methodological limitations

- Spearman ρ with N ≈ 25 is sensitive to rank ties ...

## Reverse causation

Early flight exposure is measured **before** first-wave mortality peaks; therefore, high deaths could not have caused higher December exposure. Correlation using **Dec-only** flights (ρ ≈ 0.50) shows the pattern predates policy cuts.

# Takeaway

- Early connectivity explains ~25 % of first-wave mortality rank variance.
- Association disappears by 2021 and turns negative by 2022–23.
- Supports “narrow window” efficacy of border controls; domestic factors dominate thereafter.
