# Introduction

## Context & motivation

On **31 December 2019** the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported a cluster of “viral pneumonia of unknown aetiology”; WHO issued its first Disease-Outbreak News five days later [@who2022timeline].

Europe detected its first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections on **24 January 2020**, when three travel-associated cases were reported in France [@spiteri2020]. By **21 February** only 47 cases had been notified across nine European countries—most of them imported—but two incipient chains of local transmission were already recognised, one in Bavaria (Germany) and another in Haute-Savoie (France) [@spiteri2020]. Late that same evening Italy announced the region’s first COVID-19-related death and confirmed a rapidly growing cluster of autochthonous cases in Codogno and neighbouring towns in Lombardy [@ecdcitaly2020].

The six-week hop from Wuhan to Northern Italy illustrates how long-haul aviation can relocate a pathogen within a single generation interval. A global metapopulation model by **@chinazzi2020** estimated that Wuhan’s **23 January** cordon sanitaire delayed local growth by only **3-5 days**, yet still cut *international* exportations by roughly **78 %** through mid-February [@chinazzi2020]. A narrative review of ≈ 200 studies concludes that dense pre-2020 flight networks “shrank” Europe, enabling rapid cross-border seeding before March-April capacity collapses [@sun2022_a].

Excess-mortality outcomes, however, diverged sharply thereafter. Latent-class analyses for high-income countries show that domestic factors—government effectiveness, early and stringent NPIs, vaccine roll-out, and baseline life expectancy—best explain the longer-run gaps [@rahmanian2024]. While these factors explain amplification and suppression, the **initial seeding** of infections remains less understood.

What remains unknown is how much of the first-wave mortality spread can be attributed to a country’s direct-flight exposure to **mainland China and its two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macao)** before lockdowns. This thesis addresses that empirical gap in descriptive terms.

## Research Question

> Among continental EUROCONTROL member states, is a higher volume of direct inbound flights from China/Hong Kong/Macao (Dec 2019 & Mar 2020) associated with higher cumulative excess mortality on 5 May 2020?^[Macao appears in the original acronym CN/HK/MO, but the EUROCONTROL snapshots used here show **zero** Macao-Europe flights in Dec 2019 or Mar 2020. Data handling details are given in [Data & Methods](#methods)].

## Objectives

1. **Measure exposure:** Create a country-level index of inbound IFR flights (Dec 2019, Mar 2020, sum) from EUROCONTROL data.

2. **Rank & correlate:** Compute Spearman ρ between exposure ranks and excess-mortality ranks on 5 May 2020; repeat for 2021-2023.

3. **Appraise validity:** Discuss strengths and limitations of flight counts as a proxy for epidemic seeding.

## Road-map

The remainder of the thesis is structured as follows. **Chapter 2** reviews existing literature on mobility-driven seeding and macro-level determinants of excess mortality. **Chapter 3** details data cleaning and correlation methods. Results and analyses are presented in **Chapter 4**, followed by interpretation and sensitivity checks in **Chapter 5**. Finally, **Chapter 6** summarises key findings and outlines next-step research.

# Literature Review {#litrev}

Recent syntheses—most recently @pizzato2024 map the socio-economic and vaccination gradients in Europe’s excess mortality, but they give scant attention to **importation pathways**. This thesis adds an early-mobility lens.

## Excess mortality as benchmark

Official COVID-19 death tallies are notoriously sensitive to testing capacity and certification rules.
Analyzing 35 countries, **@kelly2021** contrasted reported COVID-19 deaths with excess-death estimates built on a *fixed 2020 population denominator* and found that the residual-mortality rate (excess minus reported COVID deaths) ranged from ≈ -175 to +115 per 100 000. They conclude that “published COVID-19 death data are **not directly comparable across countries**,” reinforcing the use of excess mortality—scaled to a single mid-year population—as the more robust yard-stick.

Because this thesis tracks excess mortality **at the same calendar cut-off (5 May) for four consecutive years**, each snapshot captures the tail of Europe’s spring wave while avoiding later seasonal confounders (the rationale is detailed [Data & Methods](#methods))


## Mobility-driven seeding

A global metapopulation simulation by @chinazzi2020 showed that Wuhan’s 23 January 2020 travel ban delayed—but did not prevent—intercontinental exportations; even a 90 % cut in air traffic merely postponed the spread unless local transmission was also halved.

The result illustrates Brockmann & Helbing’s broader “effective-distance” concept [@brockmann2013]: modern hub-and-spoke aviation collapses geographical space, letting pathogens traverse continents well inside one incubation cycle. A narrative review of ≈ 200 aviation studies confirms that dense pre-2020 flight networks enabled rapid intra-EU seeding before capacity fell 60-75 % in March-April 2020 [@sun2022_a].

Building on that evidence, this thesis asks whether the volume of direct Mainland-China / Hong-Kong traffic each country received just before the shutdown helped shape its first-wave death toll.

### Role of long-haul aviation in January-February 2020 seeding {#air-seed}

A global metapopulation model seeded with IATA/OAG passenger flows showed that Wuhan’s 23 January 2020 cordon sanitaire delayed epidemic growth inside China by only 3-5 days, yet cut international export risk by roughly 78 % during the following three weeks [@chinazzi2020]. Because flights were quickly rerouted through Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Kunming, Europe’s exposure was never limited to Wuhan alone. The episode exemplifies Brockmann & Helbing’s effective-distance concept: dense hub-and-spoke networks collapse geographical space, letting pathogens cross continents within one incubation cycle. A review of ≈ 200 aviation papers later confirmed that this pre-2020 network “shrunk” Europe, enabling rapid cross-border seeding before capacity fell 60-75 % in March-April 2020 [@sun2022_a].

### Macro drivers of excess mortality {#macrodrivers}

Large comparative studies converge on three protective clusters—*socio-economic advantage, resilient health systems, and fast-acting public-health measures*.

* **@pizzato2024** show that poverty and income inequality raise, while GDP-per-capita, health spending and vaccine coverage lower, age-standardised excess mortality in 29 European countries.
* Using latent-class mixed models for 21 high-income nations, **@rahmanian2024** find that *government effectiveness*, *early stringent NPIs* and *higher full-vaccination coverage* jointly characterise the low-mortality cluster in 2020-21.
* **@matveeva2023** focus on the Delta era and confirm that late vaccine roll-out plus limited ICU capacity amplified deaths.

These studies illuminate **how countries amplified or suppressed mortality *after* the virus was inside their borders**. The present thesis steps one link earlier in the causal chain: *did heavier direct China/Hong Kong flight volumes give some countries a larger “ignition dose”, thereby biasing all subsequent outcomes?*

### Data-source considerations: EUROCONTROL vs OpenSky {#datasource}

Crowd-sourced ADS-B feeds such as **OpenSky** are fast and free, but their sensor grid over East Asia was sparse in early 2020: independent audits captured **≈ 50 %** of China-origin flights at best [@strohmeier2021; @iacus2020].  
Our own test (coverage audit) shows that OpenSky records **no** CN/HK arrivals for five EUROCONTROL states and under-counts most others.

By contrast, EUROCONTROL’s *Aviation Data Repository for Research* (**ADRR**) stores **every filed IFR flight that touches European airspace**, independent of ADS-B reception.  Public dumps are released only for four “snapshot” months (Mar | Jun | Sep | Dec); the **Dec 2019** and **Mar 2020** snapshots neatly bracket the pre-lockdown seeding window.

Because completeness is critical here, **all exposure metrics in this thesis use ADRR**; OpenSky is retained only as a **sanity-check benchmark** (details in (Coverage-audit)[#coverage-audit] and (Appendix A)[#appendix-a]).




# Data & Methods {#methods}

EUROCONTROL’s public **ADRR** snapshots record every commercial IFR movement that touches European air-space.  
For this study we extract flights whose **origin** is any airport in **mainland China (CN)** or **Hong Kong (HK)** and whose **destination** is one of the 26 continental EUROCONTROL member states. (No Macao–Europe flights appear in either snapshot, so exposure is effectively CN + HK; the full acronym *CN/HK/MO* is retained only on first mention.)

Excess-mortality outcomes come from **OWID’s** country-day series, which republishes the *World Mortality Dataset*.  
For each year 2020-2023 we take the observation **closest to 5 May** (≤ ± 7 days).

*Why 5 May?* The date captures the tail of Europe’s first epidemic wave **and** coincides with the WHO announcement (5 May 2023) that COVID-19 was no longer a global public-health emergency [@who2023end].

| $E_t$            | excess deaths / 10⁶ on 5 May $t$              | $t = 2020, 21, 22, 23$               |


### Statistical approach

* **Association.** Spearman $\rho$ between each flight metric and $E_t$.  
* **Uncertainty.** 5 000-sample percentile-bootstrap CIs (seed = 42).  
* **Sensitivity.**  
  1. replace $F_{\text{SUM}}$ with **$FPM$** (population-scaled);  
  2. restrict to countries with **complete four-year $E_t$ series**;  
  3. compute **partial Spearman** controlling for share of population ≥ 65 y.  

All analyses in **R 4.4.0**; full, reproducible pipeline lives in `notebooks/`.

A confounder sanity-check showed that adjusting for age ≥ 65 changed $\rho$ by < 0.02 in any year, so no further covariates were added (exploratory, correlation-focused study).


## Flight-exposure variable

### Snapshot source

EUROCONTROL’s *Aviation Data Repository for Research* (**ADRR**) releases full IFR
flight plans for four “snapshot” months each year (Mar | Jun | Sep | Dec).

Only the **Dec-2019** and **Mar-2020** slices bracket the early-COVID seeding window; February
is not publicly available, but rerouting via non-Wuhan hubs began well before February
[@chinazzi2020].

#### What the **S / N** codes cover

EUROCONTROL’s market-segment rules (STATFOR Doc 689 v1.1) place every type-**S** flight in **Mainline** (> 120-seat) or **Regional** (19–120-seat) and every type-**N** flight in **Charter**
[@eurocontrol2022seg]. Military (**M**), all-cargo (**F**), biz-av, etc. are filtered out *up-stream* by the ADRR commercial slice (FNI Doc 25 v6) [@eurocontrol2025meta].

##### Why this matters  

ADS-B can, in principle, see *any* transponder-equipped aircraft, but the **OpenSky** receiver network is voluntary and geographically uneven.  Coverage is dense over Western Europe yet sparse over Eastern Europe and East Asia, leading to systematic *under-counting* of CN/HK → EU flights in peripheral or low-traffic states [@strohmeier2021]. These coverage gaps generate the “phantom deficits” highlighted in the OpenSky audit (Section [#coverage-audit](#coverage-audit)). ADRR, by contrast, records every filed IFR plan, so it recovers the missing movements and offers a truer baseline for passenger-exposure analysis.

#### Load-factor caveat

Slot-retention “ghost flights” peaked in Mar–Apr 2020; @sun2022_b estimate **30–50 %** of EU departures in that window flew with < 10 % seats filled.  ADRR counts the movement but not the payload; a three-passenger A350 counts the same as a full one. At Frankfurt passenger volume fell **–73 %** while freighters + “preighters” kept **81 %** of cargo rotations alive [@fraport2021, p. 17]. Treat flight counts as *potential seeding capacity*, not realised passenger flow.


$$
F_{\text{DEC}} = \#\text{ CN/HK → EU flights in Dec 2019},\qquad
F_{\text{MAR}} = \#\text{ flights in Mar 2020},\qquad
F_{\text{SUM}} = F_{\text{DEC}} + F_{\text{MAR}}
$$

A look-up table built from **OurAirports** (airport → ISO-2) plus EUROCONTROL’s own mapping
(ISO-2 → ISO-3) assigns each flight to its destination country.

### Why fix exposure to **Dec 2019** & **Mar 2020**?

*Temporal precedence*: Both snapshots precede the 5 May outcome, eliminating reverse causation (deaths → fewer flights). Later volumes would mix cause & effect and reflect domestic restrictions rather than initial import pressure.  Extending the panel with post-2020 exposure is left for future work.

*(Full R pipeline: `notebooks/`; processed tables in `data/processed/`.)*


## Coverage audit - EUROCONTROL vs OpenSky {#coverage-audit}

OpenSky’s crowd-sourced ADS-B feed was thin over East Asia in early 2020.

* **Misses** GEO, HRV, PRT, SVK, UKR entirely  
* **Under-counts** 14 of the remaining 21 EUROCONTROL states (median deficit ≈ 12 flights)

Full details are in Appendix A (Table A.1, Fig. A.1).

Because raw ADS-B would systematically under-state exposure for peripheral markets,
the analysis relies on ADRR data and uses OpenSky **only** as a QC benchmark.

```{r tbl-os-vs-eu, echo=FALSE}
coverage_tbl |>
  dplyr::select(
    iso3,
    `Dec 2019 (EU)` = `Dec 2019 (EU)`,
    `Dec 2019 (OS)` = `Dec 2019 (OS)`,
    `Feb 2020 (OS)` = `Feb 2020 (OS)`,

## Excess-mortality snapshots {#excess-snaps}

* **Source.** **Our World in Data** (OWID) country-day series, which republish the **World Mortality Dataset** (WMD) of @karlinsky2021 and preserve its standard-error bands.  

* **Reference date.** For each calendar year we take the observation **nearest to 5 May** (within ± 7 days). Ukraine is excluded after 2021 because war disrupts reporting.  

* **Why ± 7 days?** WMD reports most countries weekly (≈ 80 %) and some fortnightly. A ± ½-week blur is trivial beside the **3 – 12 %** SEs documented for high-income Europe and still smaller than the WHO model CIs of @msemburi2023.

## Population denominator – validation & choice

OWID mid-2020 population (UN **WPP 2024** reprint) is used – the fixed-denominator convention of excess-mortality work [@karlinsky2021; @kelly2021].

* Comparing OWID to raw UN WPP (via **wpp2024** R package) for all EUROCONTROL states:  
  * 38 / 41 differ by **< 5 %** (median 2 %).  
  * Largest gaps: CYP –31 %, UKR –11 %, MKD +11 % (boundary / census updates).  
  * Re-running correlations with UN figures moved Spearman $\rho$ by **< 0.01**.  

OWID values are therefore retained for consistency with the excess-mortality numerator.  
(Details and code in `04_population_qc.qmd`.)

## Analysis workflow

1. **Define exposure metrics**

   $$
     F_{\text{DEC}},\;F_{\text{MAR}},\;
     F_{\text{SUM}} = F_{\text{DEC}} + F_{\text{MAR}}
   $$

2. **Assemble outcome series**

   $$
     E_t = \text{excess deaths / 10⁶ on 5 May } t,
     \quad t \in \{2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\}
   $$

3. **Main test** – Spearman $\rho$ + 95 % bootstrap CI for every $F_k \times E_t$.

4. **Sensitivity panel**

   | Label        | Modification                                   | Purpose                    |
   |--------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
   | **FPM**      | Scale exposure by population                   | Check size artefact        |
   | **COMPLETE** | Keep only countries with 4-year $E_t$ series   | Missing-data bias          |
   | **AGE 65 +** | Partial Spearman (control % ≥ 65 y)            | Confounder sanity-check    |

5. **Reproducibility** – Code, data and rendered Quarto notebooks are version-tracked in the project repo.

### Visual encoding & accessibility {#viz-note}

All categorical plots use the **Okabe-Ito** colour-universal palette [@okabe2002] (`#009E73 green, #E69F00 orange, #56B4E9 blue …`). Viridis scales handle continuous variables. Axis titles, direct labels and dashed reference lines ensure information survives greyscale printing and the main forms of colour-vision deficiency. Hues with strong cultural valence (e.g. alert-red) are avoided to minimise framing bias.

## Digital Methods & Reproducibility {#digmethods}

*This project is as much about **doing** digital research as it is about analysing digital traces. Five design choices make the workflow transparent, portable, and criticisable.*

1. **Data-infrastructure awareness** Two complementary data streams are interrogated: crowd-sourced ADS-B (**OpenSky**) with patchy East-Asian coverage and no load factors, versus regulator-grade IFR plans (**EUROCONTROL ADRR**) with full spatial coverage but equally no passenger counts.   Mapping the blind spots of each stream (Section [#coverage-audit](#coverage-audit)) is integral to the method, not an after-thought.

2. **Single-command rebuild** A bash wrapper `build.sh` orchestrates the complete pipeline *raw CSV → clean RDS → Quarto → final HTML Manuscript*.   Running the script on a fresh clone regenerates every table and figure without manual edits, except the CSV.

3. **Pinned R environment** The repository carries an `renv.lock` snapshot.  Restoring that lock guarantees the identical package stack used during development; in `R/00_load_libs.R` installs any missing packages if the lock is absent.

4. **Path-safe, self-checking code** All notebooks build paths with `here::here()`, so the project runs from any working directory. `build.sh` stops early with a clear message, if the large ADRR CSV dumps are missing.

5. **Licence-respecting version control** Code, Quarto sources and lightweight derived data live in a private Git repo (MIT licence on release). Large or restricted datasets, notably the EUROCONTROL snapshots stay outside Git; the README explains how researchers can obtain them under the proper R&D terms.

# Results {#results}

## Data completeness & descriptive checks

```{r complete_tbl, echo=FALSE}
comp_tbl <- analysis_df |>
  dplyr::summarise(
    n_rows = n(),
    n_countries_total = dplyr::n_distinct(iso3),
    n_target_dates = dplyr::n_distinct(target_date),
    rows_with_flights = sum(!is.na(total_inbound_flights_combined)),
    rows_missing_flights = sum(is.na(total_inbound_flights_combined)),
    rows_with_mortality = sum(!is.na(excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million)),
    rows_missing_mortality = sum(is.na(excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million))
  ) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    pct_missing_flights = sprintf("%.1f %%", 100 * rows_missing_flights / n_rows),
    pct_missing_mortality = sprintf("%.1f %%", 100 * rows_missing_mortality / n_rows)
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(
    `Rows (panel)` = n_rows,
    Countries = n_countries_total,
    `Reference years` = n_target_dates,
    `Rows with flights` = rows_with_flights,
    `Rows missing flights` = rows_missing_flights,
    `% flight NA` = pct_missing_flights,
    `Rows with mortality` = rows_with_mortality,
    `Rows missing mortality` = rows_missing_mortality,
    `% mortality NA` = pct_missing_mortality
  )

knitr::kable(
  comp_tbl,
  caption = "Completeness of the analysis panel (Dec-2019 & Mar-2020 exposure × 2020-23 mortality snapshots)."
)
```

The final analysis panel is fully balanced: all 26 continental EUROCONTROL states have complete flight-exposure and excess-mortality data for each of the four reference years (2020-2023), with 0 % missing cells.

## Early exposure landscape

> **Early exposure landscape.** Direct CN/HK flights funnelled into just a few Western gateways. @top10_eu_dest_cntry shows that DEU, GBR and NLD alone handled > 60 % of all arrivals in December 2019, and they kept that lead even after traffic collapsed in March. Those same hubs also drew from the *widest mix* of Chinese origins: London‑Heathrow was linked to 15, Paris‑CDG to 13, and Frankfurt to 12 source airports (@fig-origins_per_destination). Finally, volume and diversity rose in lock‑step (Spearman ρ ≈ 0.86; @fig-scatter_volume_vs_origins). **Liège (LGG)** is the one clear outlier high diversity for only ~200 flights because most of its rotations were freighters (see [Data Limitations](#data-limitations)).

> *Together, these three plots show that both *how much* traffic and *how many* source cities were concentrated in the same Western hubs, setting up a right‑skewed exposure profile at country level.*


### A handful of gateways handled almost all traffic

Before the pandemic shock, direct CN/HK traffic into Europe was extremely skewed. @fig-top10_eu_dest_cntry ranks the **Top-10 destination countries** and already shows that three Western hubs—**Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands—absorbed > 60 % of all arrivals** in December 2019 and still dominated after the March collapse.


```{r fig-top10_eu_dest_cntry, out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Top-10 European destinations for direct CN/HK passenger flights in December 2019 (orange), March 2020 (blue), and combined (green). Bars are counts of filed IFR passenger plans."}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/bar_top10_destinations.png")
```

> Take-away: Import pressure was not evenly distributed across Europe: a few Western gateways shouldered the lion’s share of flights in both study months, setting the stage for a right-skewed country-level exposure index.

### The same hubs drew the widest origin mix

```{r fig-origins_per_destination, out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="How many distinct CN/HK airports fed each EUROCONTROL destination? Left = combined Dec 2019 + Mar 2020; right = month-by-month. Western megahubs such as **LHR (15 origins), CDG (13), FRA (12)** top the list. **Liège (LGG)** appears high despite modest volume because it is a cargo gateway, illustrating that flight counts can overstate passenger exposure at freight airports."}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/bar_origins_per_destination.png")
```

> **Volume and diversity rise in tandem:** each extra ~100 flights brings one-to-two additional Chinese origin airports (airport-level Spearman ρ ≈ 0.86, p < 0.001).

### Volume tracks diversity

```{r fig-scatter_volume_vs_origin, out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Each dot is one EUROCONTROL destination airport. Flight volume is the combined Dec-2019 + Mar-2020 total (log-scale); route diversity is the number of distinct CN/HK origin airports. Spearman ρ ≈ 0.86 (p < 0.001, n = 47). Liège (LGG) lies above the trend high diversity for moderate volume—because almost all of its flights were cargo."}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/scatter_volume_vs_origins.png")
```

**Interpretation.**
Flight **volume** and **origin diversity** rise in lock-step (≈ 1–2 extra origins per +100 flights). The relationship is driven by the major passenger hubs in the upper-right corner; everywhere else remains low-volume and low-diversity. **Liège (LGG)** is the one clear freight-driven outlier—its seven Chinese origins supplied mainly cargo rotations, so it inflates exposure without adding many travellers (see [Data Limitations](#data-limitation)).

> **So what?**  Because both dimensions of exposure are so right-skewed, we expect the country-level correlation with excess mortality to be pulled by the same handful of Western hubs. The next section tests exactly that.

### The March cliff‑edge {#march-cliff}

Only countries with a **meaningful December baseline** are shown.  
We keep the 21 EUROCONTROL states that logged **≥ 5 direct CN/HK flights in Dec 2019**; anything smaller (e.g. Croatia’s single inbound charter) would make a –100 % bar noisy but epidemiologically trivial.

The same ≥ 5‑flight filter is used for:

* **Figure @fig-pct_change_filtered** (percentage‑change bar plot)  
* **Table @tbl-collapse** (absolute Δ‑flights in the appendix)

All later correlation work (Section @exposure-mortality) returns to the full 26‑country panel.

```{r fig-pct_change_filtered, out.width="80%", fig.cap="Percentage change in direct CN/HK flights between the December 2019 baseline and March 2020 for countries with ≥5 December flights (n = 21). Every country cut traffic by at least 50%; 7/21 reduced >90%, and 14/21 ≥75%. Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany retained the highest residual volumes.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/pct_change_filtered.png")
```

**What the figure shows.**
Among the **21 countries with ≥ 5 December flights**, every one had cut traffic by **at least 50 %** by the end of March 2020:

* **7 / 21 slashed > 90 %**—the bars pinned hard against −100 %.
* **14 / 21 cut ≥ 75 %**—another sign of a tightly synchronised shutdown.
* **Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany** are the only three retaining anything like half their December volume—yet even they are down 30‑50 %. Much of that “surviving” activity is freight or near‑empty slot‑holders (see [Data limitations](#data-limitations)).

| signal            | take‑away                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Timing**        | The plunge coincides with the **EU/Schengen external‑border stop (17 Mar)** and China’s **“Five‑One” rule (26 Mar)** limiting each airline to one weekly CN–EU rotation.             |
| **Uniformity**    | Because the contraction is pan‑European—not just Italy or Spain—any exposure‑mortality link must be driven by traffic that occurred *before* the cliff.                              |
| **Residual risk** | Absolute flight counts still diverged after March: a handful of hubs kept 200‑350 rotations, so a trickle of import potential remained (see Δ‑flights column in the appendix table). |

With CN/HK traffic cut to a trickle after late March, any differences we still observe in first‑wave mortality have to stem from flights that landed **before** the cliff‑edge. The next section tests whether that pre‑collapse exposure is visible in countries’ excess‑mortality snapshots for 5 May 2020.

*(External yard‑stick: by December 2020, CN–EU long‑haul capacity was ≈ 7 % of 2019 levels, while China’s domestic network had already rebounded to ≈ 93 % [@warnocksmith2021].)*




[NEXT TODO! CHECKUP!]

### Baseline 2020 snapshot – 5 May 2020 {#baseline‑2020}

```{r tbl-spearman_2020, echo = FALSE}
tbl_2020 <- spearman_res |>

gap <- with(
  snap20,
  median(excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million[total_inbound_flights_combined >= q[2]]) -
    median(excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million[total_inbound_flights_combined <= q[1]])
)
gap <- round(gap) # 465
```

```{r fig-scatter-2020, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.7, fig.cap = "Direct CN/HK flights (Dec 2019 + Mar 2020, log‑scale) versus excess deaths per million on 5 May 2020. Spearman $\\rho \\approx 0.53$ (*p*< 0.01)."}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/scatter_2020.png")
```


**Reading the 2020 snapshot.**  
All four exposure metrics are positively associated with first‑wave excess mortality (Table @tbl-tbl_spearman_2020). Using the **combined Dec + Mar count**:

* **Spearman ρ ≈ 0.53** (95 % CI 0.18 – 0.77, *p* = 0.007).
* Countries in the **top exposure quartile** recorded **≈ `r gap` excess deaths / million** more than those in the bottom quartile.
* Figure @fig-scatter-2020 shows that the right‑hand tail is pulled by the big Western gateways (**DEU, GBR, NLD, FRA, ESP, ITA**).

Because exposure is measured **before** the 5 May outcome, reverse causation is implausible for the December slice and largely mitigated for the March slice.

The next subsection tracks the same correlation through **2021–23** to see how quickly the signal fades.



### Does the signal persist? (2020 → 2023)


```{r tbl-spearman_all, echo=FALSE}
tbl_all <- spearman_res |>
  dplyr::select(year, variable, rho, ci_lo, ci_hi, p, n) |>
  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(.x, 3)))

knitr::kable(
  tbl_all,
  caption = "Table X — Spearman $\\rho$ between early flight exposure and cumulative excess mortality, 2020–2023."
)
```

```{r fig-rho_caterpillar, fig.cap="95 % bootstrap CIs confirm that only the 2020 estimate differs significantly from zero.", fig.asp=0.6}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/rho_caterpillar.png")
```

Figure @fig-rho_caterpillar shows that only the 2020 coefficient is significantly positive; from 2021 onward the confidence intervals straddle (or fall below) zero, confirming the sign‑flip.


### Sensitivity & partial checks

```{r tbl-sensitivity, echo=FALSE}
sens_tbl <- partial_by_year |>
  dplyr::select(year,
    `ρ baseline` = rho_baseline,
    `ρ adj age 65+` = rho_adj_age,
    `p adj` = p_adj_age
  ) |>
  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3))

knitr::kable(sens_tbl,
  caption = "Sensitivity checks: baseline vs partial Spearman controlling for age ≥ 65."
)
```

*Controlling for population share ≥ 65 changes ρ by ≤ 0.02 in any year (Table @tbl-tbl_sensitivity). The sign‑flip therefore cannot be explained by age structure.*

### Key take‑away

Early direct flights from China and Hong Kong left a clear statistical footprint on Europe’s **first‑wave** excess mortality, but that imprint **evaporated within a year**. Once SARS‑CoV‑2 was established, domestic factors—age, health‑system capacity, vaccination, socioeconomic vulnerability—overwhelmed any lingering signal from pre‑lockdown air connectivity.


# Discussion

## Interpretation of Findings 

Early international connectivity mattered—but only briefly.  
In 2020, countries in the top quartile of direct CN/HK flight exposure registered **≈ 55 % higher excess mortality** than the bottom quartile, and the rank-based association was moderate-to-strong (Spearman ρ = 0.526, 95 % CI 0.177 - 0.771, *p* = 0.007; Table @tbl-spearman_all).

The signal then **collapsed**: ρ fell to -0.306 in 2021 (CI -0.622 - 0.111, n.s.) and turned **significantly negative** in 2022 (ρ = -0.460, 95 % CI -0.792 - -0.001, *p* = 0.021) and remained negative in 2023 (ρ = -0.419, 95 % CI -0.749 - 0.045, *p* = 0.037).  

A one-shot confounder check (@tbl-sensitivity) showed that controlling for the share of population ≥ 65 y alters ρ by < 0.02 in any year, confirming that age structure is not driving the pattern.


[Here the Timeline Plot!]

## Relation to Broader Structural Factors

Several country-level attributes likely modulated the time-varying ρ pattern:

* **Wealth & vulnerability effects.**  In Ioannidis et al.’s 34-country panel the *percentage* excess-death burden (P-score) correlated **inversely** with GDP-per-capita (Spearman ρ ≈ -0.60) and **positively** with both the share of population in poverty and the Gini index of income inequality [@ioannidis2023].  Because the most flight-connected countries in our sample are also among the wealthiest, **this socioeconomic buffer plausibly helps explain why our flight-mortality correlation flips negative after 2021.**
   
* **Vaccination rollout.** OWID data show that by **5 May 2022** countries in the highest-exposure quartile had a median **≈ 78 %** of their populations fully vaccinated, compared with **≈ 62 %** in the lowest-exposure quartile—a **16-percentage-point lead** that likely suppressed late-wave mortality in the highly connected group and contributed to the sign-flip after 2021.

* **Policy timing & capacity.** Countries that paired **high government effectiveness** with **early, stringent domestic NPIs** clustered in the lowest excess-mortality group during 2020-21 [@rahmanian2024].  Consistent with those findings, @sun2022_a show that stand-alone travel bans are blunt unless layered with vaccination and local measures and their Europe-focused load-factor study demonstrates that a timely slot-waiver quickly eliminated “ghost flights” [@sun2022_b].  Taken together with our results, these lines of evidence suggest that international flight exposure mattered only for the first wave; thereafter, domestic defences dominated.

Taken together, **initial flight exposure shaped only the first wave**; once SARS-CoV-2 circulated locally, domestic resources and policy dominated the death toll. This helps explain why the mobility signal vanishes—and even inverts—after 2020.

## Limitations  (CONCLUSION REIN BAUEN ! KRITIKPUNKTE !  Found out that bla , 2 Absätze dann limitations dannach ausblick / Future Work )

This study is deliberately exploratory and country-level; several caveats constrain interpretation.

### Data limitations {#data-limitation}

* **Ghost / abnormal flights (load-factor bias).** “Slot-retention” flights peaked in Europe right after the first lockdown: Sun et al. detect **> 40 % low-load outliers** in April 2020 among major LCCs, clustered on dense Level-3 airport pairs such as AMS-BCN and ATH-MAD [@sun2022_b]. Because our exposure metric counts flight plans, not passengers, it over-weights these nearly empty sectors—and likewise any long-haul ghost service such as the high-fare, low-load **HKG-LHR** link documented by @warnocksmith2021.

* **Freight-heavy hubs accentuate the bias.** Frankfurt’s 2020 passenger throughput crashed to **18.8 m** (-73 %), yet cargo slipped only -8 %; conversely the pure-cargo hub Liège handled **1.11 Mt** of freight (**+23 % YoY**), ranking sixth in Europe [@fraport2021, p. 40]. Our flight counts therefore over-state human exposure wherever cargo or slot-retention flights dominate.

* **Flight-exposure proxy.** We tally IFR plans of type “S”/“N” (scheduled or non-scheduled commercial). Passenger loads are unknown, so ghost flights and cargo-only services inflate exposure. At cargo hubs such as Liège or Frankfurt, flight counts remained high despite few travellers, potentially overstating human seeding pressure.

* **Two-month window.** EUROCONTROL publishes only Mar | Jun | Sep | Dec snapshots; February 2020—the critical month between Wuhan lockdown and Europe’s first importations—is missing.  

* **Indirect routings.** Itineraries via third-country hubs (e.g., PVG → DXB → VIE) are not captured, so exposure is under-estimated for transfer states and over-estimated for direct-flight hubs.

**Excess-mortality uncertainty.**  WMD provides weekly (≈ 80 % of our sample) or fortnightly blocks; our ± 7-day window adds at most a ± ½-week blur. @karlinsky2021 put the resulting sampling error at **3-12 %** for high-income Europe, while the WHO model published by @msemburi2023. shows even broader credible intervals and warns that *“basing rankings on point estimates will often be misleading”* (p. 134) [@karlinsky2021; @msemburi2023]. In addition, registration lags, baseline-fit choices and war-time disruption (e.g. Ukraine ≥ 2022) leave some residual cross-country
noise [@kelly2021].

* **Population denominator.** OWID mid-2020 estimates differ from raw UN-WPP by < 5 % for 38 / 41 countries; switching to WPP shifts ρ by < 0.01, so OWID values are retained (see *04_population_qc*).

### Methodological limitations

* **Ecological design & small N.** Results rest on ≈ 25 national aggregates; sub-national heterogeneity is hidden, and bootstrap CIs remain wide.  
* **No causal ranking.**  Ioannidis et al. stress that “*country vulnerability dominated the cumulative impact*” and warn that **ranking national responses on raw excess-death point estimates is misleading**.  Accordingly, our study remains exploratory: confounding from wealth, NPIs, vaccination and health-system resources cannot be ruled out [@ioannidis2023].
* **Residual confounding.**  Excess-mortality gaps closely track GDP and poverty—variables we do **not** adjust for—so part of our observed relationship may reflect socioeconomic risk rather than direct effects of early air connectivity [@ioannidis2023; @msemburi2023].

> **Bottom line.** Early direct flights plausibly seeded Europe’s first wave, but measurement error, ecological fallacy, and unmeasured confounders preclude strong causal claims about long-run border control effectiveness.








### Methodological Reflections 

The earliest project sketch—floated by Neuwirth on the Z_GIS thesis blog in Nov 2024 [@neuwirth2024]—envisioned a global SIR network on “effective-distance” air routes [@brockmann2013]. A quick reality-check of open ADS-B coverage (see Appendix A) showed that February-2020 China-Europe traffic is too thin for such simulation, so the design pivoted to a descriptive, Europe-only correlation.

I prototyped that approach, together with SEIR-style extensions summarised for clinicians by [@abou2020] (and, more recently, the multi-stage SEnIR work of [@rozan2024]). In practice, two constraints proved decisive:

1. **Data gaps & granularity** - OpenSky ADS-B traces miss large parts of mainland-Chinese airspace in Jan-Feb 2020, and the publicly released EUROCONTROL archive offers only four snapshot months (Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec) each year—fine for a one-off exposure index, but too sparse for a day-by-day SIR/SEIR simulation.

2. **Scope** - Calibrating a global SIR/SEIR within the 300-hour cap of a bachelor’s thesis was unrealistic.

Accordingly, I pivoted to a lean, descriptive design: rank-correlating fixed pre-epidemic flight exposure with subsequent excess mortality. While less mechanistic, the approach is fully reproducible with public data and still illuminates the early-seeding question.


# Conclusion

## Key Findings  

Our exploratory rank‑correlation shows that heavy direct CN/HK traffic **explains a sizeable share of Europe’s first‑wave excess mortality (ρ≈0.53, p<0.01)**, but the signal disappears — and reverses — after 2020, once domestic factors dominate.

## Limitations  

* **Flight metric ≠ passengers.** Cargo‑ & Ghost‑flights inflation possible; loads unknown.  
* **Snapshot gap.** No February ADRR slice ⇒ possible under‑/mis‑allocation of exposure.  
* **Ecological n ≈ 25.** Country‑level design: residual confounding (wealth, NPI strength, ICU capacity) cannot be ruled out.

## Implications & Future Work

Early border controls can *buy time*, but sustained mortality differences hinge on internal capacity (vaccines, healthcare, governance). Future work should  
1. add passenger‑level data (IATA/OAG) to down‑weight cargo rotations,  
2. extend exposure beyond direct flights (multi‑leg itineraries, maritime links), and  
3. test sub‑national panels to reduce ecological fallacy.

**Why Exploratory Work Matters.** Transparent, fully reproducible pipelines let other researchers critique, extend, or reuse every step — essential when policy stakes and data gaps are high.

**Figure A.2**: Top-10 destinations by number of direct CN/HK flights in OpenSky data (Dec 2019, Feb 2020, Mar 2020). OpenSky data reflects community ADS-B coverage, not actual filed flights, and shows significant variation between months. The grouped bar format highlights erratic coverage patterns and explains why EUROCONTROL data was prioritized.
