## Introduction

### Context & motivation

When SARS‑CoV‑2 emerged in late 2019, the global airline network compressed inter‑city travel times to hours, not weeks. Modelling studies show that long‑haul flights shorten the “effective distance” between outbreak foci and distant populations, speeding the first wave of infections [@chinazzi2020; @sun2022_a].

Yet European countries later displayed wide gaps in excess mortality. Analysts have linked those gaps to demography, health‑system capacity, and policy timing [@rahmanian2024; @matveeva2023]. How much of the early mortality spread can be traced to initial exposure via direct flights from China and its two SARs? The question remains largely descriptive—and unanswered.

### Research Question

> Among continental Eurocontrol member states, is a higher volume of direct inbound flights from China/HongKong/Macao (Dec 2019 & Mar 2020) associated with higher cumulative excess mortality on 5 May 2020?

Snapshots for 2021‑2023 are analysed as robustness checks.

### Objectives

**1. Measure exposure:** Create a country‑level index of inbound IFR flights (Dec 2019, Mar 2020, sum) from EUROCONTROL data.

**2. Rank & correlate:** Compute Spearman ρ between exposure ranks and excess‑mortality ranks on 5 May 2020; repeat for 2021‑2023.

**3. Appraise validity:** Discuss strengths and limits of flight counts as a proxy for epidemic seeding.

### Road-map

- Chapter 2 reviews work on mobility‑driven seeding and excess‑mortality metrics.
- Chapter 3 details data cleaning and the correlation method.
- Chapter 4 presents exposure rankings, maps, and ρ results.
- Chapter 5 interprets the patterns, weighs confounders, and tests sensitivity.
- Chapter 6 summarises key findings and outlines next‑step research.

## Literature Review {#litrev}

Recent syntheses (e.g. [@pizzato2024]) show wide cross‑country gaps in European excess‑mortality and point to socio‑economic gradients, health‑system capacity and vaccination uptake as major drivers. This thesis adds an early‑mobility angle that those studies treat only tangentially.

### Excess mortality as benchmark

[TODO: Brief paragraph: why excess deaths capture the full health burden better than case or COVID‑death counts; citation to WMD, HMD‑STMF.]

### Mobility‑driven seeding

[TODO: One paragraph: network epidemiology concept of “effective distance” [cite Brockmann & Helbing 2013]; empirical links between flight volume and first‑wave seeding (e.g. [@chinazzi2020] global; [@sun2022_a] intra‑EU).]

[Comment:
- TODO: Outline the key studies that have used air-traffic data to study COVID-19 transmission dynamics. DONT OVERDO IT. Understanding and interpretation counts. Not mindlessly listing studies.
- Ton of the next ### are more.. Methodological than literature review.]

### Why Eurocontrol, not OpenSky

OpenSky’s crowd‑sourced ADS‑B receivers leave blind spots across East Asia; many CN → EU flights in Dec‑19 are simply absent (Appendix Fig X). Eurocontrol, by contrast, records every IFR movement that crosses its network boundary. For this project the exposure metric is therefore realised flights (Eurocontrol), not scheduled seats or partial ADS‑B traces. OpenSky appears only to illustrate its coverage bias.

[TODO: Create Opensky map again...]

## Data & Methods {#methods}

### Study design

Exploratory, cross‑sectional correlation at the *country* level.

Outcome = cumulative excess‑deaths / million on 5 May of 2020‑23.  

Exposure = direct CN/HK/MO → Eurocontrol flights in Dec 2019 and Mar 2020.

### Flight-exposure data

*Source* Eurocontrol “Aviation Data Repository for Research” archive.  
Filters ICAO types S/N; ADEP $∈$ {CN, HK, MO}; ADES $∈$ 26 continental member states.
Aggregation destination‐country counts →

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{\text{DEC}} &=\; \text{Flights in Dec 2019}\\
F_{\text{MAR}} &=\; \text{Flights in Mar 2020}\\
F_{\text{SUM}} &=\; F_{\text{DEC}} + F_{\text{MAR}}
\end{aligned}

*Reference date* closest non‑NA within **± 7 days of 5 May**; Ukraine excluded after 2021 (data break due to war).

### Analytical variables

| Symbol | Definition | Transformation |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------- |


### Statistical approach

* Spearman $ρ$ between each flight metric and $E_t$.  
* 5000‑sample bootstrap CIs.  
* Sensitivity checks:
  1. exclude countries < 2 M pop;  
  2. use $FPM$;
  3. drop countries with any missing $E$ snapshot

Analyses were performed in **R 4.4**; the full script and data pipeline are available in `notebooks/`.

**Population normalization:**

Population denominators use the 2020 mid‑year estimates from the UN World Population Prospects (WPP 2024 revision). This choice is justified because European populations change by less than ±1 % from year to year, making the 2020 estimate a robust and standard baseline for per‑capita analyses. Using a fixed population denominator aligns with common practice in epidemiological studies of COVID‑19 excess mortality (e.g., [@karlinsky2021; @kelly2021]), where mid‑year population values serve as the most representative measure of the population at risk. A sensitivity check (Appendix X, Table X) shows that normalizing flights by later‑year populations changes Spearman coefficients only in the third or fourth decimal place.

### Analysis workflow

1. **Exposure metrics**  
   $F_{\text{DEC}};F_{\text{MAR}},$
   $F_{\text{SUM}} = F_{\text{DEC}} + F_{\text{MAR}}$

2. **Outcome series**  
   $E_t$– cumulative excess deaths / million on 5 May 2020–2023.

3. **Main test**  
   Spearman $ρ$ (two‑tailed) for every $F \times E_t$ pair;  
   5 000‑sample percentile bootstrap for 95 % CI.

4. **Sensitivity panel**

   | Label | Change | Purpose |
   |--------|--------|---------|
   | POP‑cut | drop < 2 M pop | small‑country leverage |
   | FPM | flights per million pop | relative exposure |
   | COMPLETE | require full four‑year ($E_t$) series | missing‑data bias 

5. **Reproducibility**  
   R 4.4.0; libraries; scripts in `notebooks/` tracked via GitHub.







# Results

This chapter presents the results of the exploratory analysis investigating the association between early international flight exposure and cumulative excess mortality in European countries. It includes a descriptive overview of the flight data, early air connectivity patterns, country exposure rankings, and the results of the correlation analyses. Where relevant, additional sensitivity analyses are provided to assess the robustness of findings.

## Data coverages & descriptives

| Month | # flight (total) | Median / country | Min-Max |
|-------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Dec 2019 |  |  |  |

*Table 4.1: Descriptive statistics of inbound flight data.*

## Early air-connectivity patterns

> **Note on visual encoding:** To avoid unintended cultural or emotional interpretations, color palettes in maps and flow diagrams were deliberately selected to avoid connotations such as red = danger/blame. Additionally, all figures were designed to be accessible to readers with color vision deficiencies by using colorblind-safe palettes and clear labeling. These choices support neutral, inclusive, and responsible data visualization.

[Notes for Figures]
4.1. Stack two coloured bars per country (legend “Dec / Mar”). Order by Dec count so the drop is obvious. - example: “Inbound CN/HK/MO → EU flights (IFR), top‑15 destinations.”
4.2. Flow graphic – Shows who flew to whom; gives geographical intuition that a plain bar cannot. - If Sankyey, cleaner for volumes, but beware Variables.
4.3 Choropleth (per‑country totals, same palette).
4.4. Daily flight profile within each sample month - Demonstrates intra‑month variability (e.g. the steep drop after 15 Mar). - Two separate facets: “Dec 2019” and “Mar 2020” - Bar on thin line; y-axis = flights/day. - Insert grey panel: “No data Jan–Feb 2020” between facets

## Country exposure rankings

A ranking of European countries based on their total inbound flight exposure is presented.

- Separate ranking for **December 2019** and **March 2020**
- Combined ranking aggregating total exposure (December + March)

### Sensitivity Analyses

[TODO: evaluating the robustness of the observed correlation patterns, additional sensitivity analyses]

- **Exclusion of countries with incomplete mortality data:**  
Countries lacking complete excess mortality records for all four reference timepoints removed.

- **Normalization by population size:**  
Flight exposure indicators normalized by country population (in millions) to evaluate whether relative exposure, rather than absolute flight volume, influenced correlation outcomes.

- **Separate analysis by month:**  
Correlation analyses repeated separately for December 2019 and March 2020 to explore potential timing effects. ->

## Key patterns & short recap

[Transission to the next section]

The following chapter discusses these findings in the broader context of structural factors and methodological considerations














## Discussion

### Interpretation of Findings

[My discussion of the Spearman correlations, ranking, and visual insights.]

### Relation to Broader Structural Factors

While factors such as GDP per capita, healthcare capacity, and vaccination coverage are widely considered to influence pandemic mortality [SOURCES!], these were not included as covariates in the correlation analysis to preserve interpretive clarity. This thesis focuses on early air connectivity as an exploratory lens, rather than constructing a multivariate explanatory model. Future work could meaningfully expand on this analysis by integrating these additional dimensions.

[Now, how things like GDP, vaccination, age structure, or healthcare could interact.]

### Limitations 
[Likely needs more meat - might combine it with Methodological Reflections]

This thesis deliberately applies an exploratory, correlation-based approach to investigate potential associations between early international air connectivity and excess mortality. The following key limitations must be acknowledged:

- **No causal inference:** The observed correlations do not imply causation. Socioeconomic, demographic, and healthcare-related factors likely contributed substantially to mortality outcomes [@ioannidis2023; @pizzato2024].

- **Country-level aggregation:** National-level analysis may obscure subnational differences in both exposure and vulnerability.

- **Flight data uncertainty:** Exposure estimates are based on seat capacities rather than confirmed passengers. Volatile occupancy rates and ghost flights during early 2020 limit the accuracy of this metric. 

- **Eurocontrol data limitations:** The dataset also tracks ADEP and ADES that get communicated but not Shanghai -> Dubai -> Vienna. Which whould therefore count as Dubai -> Vienna. This could lead to undercounting of flights.

> While airports like Dubai or Doha were important global transfer points in February, this thesis focuses on **direct seeding from China** and **intra-European flows**. Modeling later pandemic phases or full global mobility networks exceeds the practical scope of this project.

- **Mortality data quality:** Excess mortality estimates vary in completeness across countries due to differences in death registration systems. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05522-2)


### Methodological Reflections

Early versions of this research design included dynamic modeling approaches such as a network-based SIR simulation [@brockmann2013] or SEIR extensions [@abou2020; @rozan2024]. However, incomplete flight records for January–February 2020, combined with uneven global data coverage and the practical time constraints of a Bachelor's thesis (~300 hours), rendered such approaches infeasible. A simplified, descriptive correlation analysis was chosen to maintain feasibility and transparency while stillallowing meaningful insights into early pandemic exposure patterns.

## Conclusion

### Key Findings

### Implications & Future Work

### Why Exploratory Work Matters
Although this thesis does not make causal claims, its findings demonstrate the value of transparent, reproducible exploratory analysis. When approached with methodological humility and critical awareness, even basic statistical patterns—such as the timing and structure of early international flight exposure—can yield insights into complex public health events. In a field often pressured by urgent narratives or overstated certainty, exploratory studies like this play a role in grounding interpretation and informing future research directions.
