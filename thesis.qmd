# Introduction

## Context & motivation

On **31 December 2019** the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported a cluster of “viral pneumonia of unknown aetiology”; WHO issued its first Disease-Outbreak News five days later [@who2022timeline].

Europe detected its first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections on **24 January 2020**, when three travel-associated cases were reported in France [@spiteri2020]. By **21 February** only 47 cases had been notified across nine European countries—most of them imported—but two incipient chains of local transmission were already recognised, one in Bavaria (Germany) and another in Haute-Savoie (France) [@spiteri2020]. Late that same evening Italy announced the region’s first COVID-19-related death and confirmed a rapidly growing cluster of autochthonous cases in Codogno and neighbouring towns in Lombardy [@ecdcitaly2020].

The six-week hop from Wuhan to Northern Italy illustrates how long-haul aviation can relocate a pathogen within a single generation interval. A global metapopulation model by **@chinazzi2020** estimated that Wuhan’s **23 January** cordon sanitaire delayed local growth by only **3-5 days**, yet still cut *international* exportations by roughly **78 %** through mid-February [@chinazzi2020]. A narrative review of ≈ 200 studies concludes that dense pre-2020 flight networks “shrank” Europe, enabling rapid cross-border seeding before March-April capacity collapses [@sun2022_a].

Excess-mortality outcomes, however, diverged sharply thereafter. Latent-class analyses for high-income countries show that domestic factors—government effectiveness, early and stringent NPIs, vaccine roll-out, and baseline life expectancy—best explain the longer-run gaps [@rahmanian2024]. While these factors explain amplification and suppression, the **initial seeding** of infections remains less understood.

What remains unknown is how much of the first-wave mortality spread can be attributed to a country’s direct-flight exposure to **mainland China and its two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macao)** before lockdowns. This thesis addresses that empirical gap in descriptive terms.

## Research Question

> Among continental EUROCONTROL member states, is a higher volume of direct inbound flights from China/Hong Kong/Macao (Dec 2019 & Mar 2020) associated with higher cumulative excess mortality on 5 May 2020?^[Macao appears in the original acronym CN/HK/MO, but the EUROCONTROL snapshots used here show **zero** Macao-Europe flights in Dec 2019 or Mar 2020. Data handling details are given in [Data & Methods](#methods)].

## Objectives

1. **Measure exposure:** Create a country-level index of inbound IFR flights (Dec 2019, Mar 2020, sum) from EUROCONTROL data.

2. **Rank & correlate:** Compute Spearman ρ between exposure ranks and excess-mortality ranks on 5 May 2020; repeat for 2021-2023.

3. **Appraise validity:** Discuss strengths and limitations of flight counts as a proxy for epidemic seeding.

## Road-map

The remainder of the thesis is structured as follows. **Chapter 2** reviews existing literature on mobility-driven seeding and macro-level determinants of excess mortality. **Chapter 3** details data cleaning and correlation methods. Results and analyses are presented in **Chapter 4**, followed by interpretation and sensitivity checks in **Chapter 5**. Finally, **Chapter 6** summarises key findings and outlines next-step research.

# Literature Review {#litrev}

Recent syntheses—most recently @pizzato2024 map the socio-economic and vaccination gradients in Europe’s excess mortality, but they give scant attention to **importation pathways**. This thesis adds an early-mobility lens.

## Excess mortality as benchmark

Official COVID-19 death tallies are notoriously sensitive to testing capacity and certification rules.
Analyzing 35 countries, **@kelly2021** contrasted reported COVID-19 deaths with excess-death estimates built on a *fixed 2020 population denominator* and found that the residual-mortality rate (excess minus reported COVID deaths) ranged from ≈ -175 to +115 per 100 000. They conclude that “published COVID-19 death data are **not directly comparable across countries**,” reinforcing the use of excess mortality—scaled to a single mid-year population—as the more robust yard-stick.

Because this thesis tracks excess mortality **at the same calendar cut-off (5 May) for four consecutive years**, each snapshot captures the tail of Europe’s spring wave while avoiding later seasonal confounders (the rationale is detailed [Data & Methods](#methods))


## Mobility-driven seeding

A global metapopulation simulation by @chinazzi2020 showed that Wuhan’s 23 January 2020 travel ban delayed—but did not prevent—intercontinental exportations; even a 90 % cut in air traffic merely postponed the spread unless local transmission was also halved.

The result illustrates Brockmann & Helbing’s broader “effective-distance” concept [@brockmann2013]: modern hub-and-spoke aviation collapses geographical space, letting pathogens traverse continents well inside one incubation cycle. A narrative review of ≈ 200 aviation studies confirms that dense pre-2020 flight networks enabled rapid intra-EU seeding before capacity fell 60-75 % in March-April 2020 [@sun2022_a].

Building on that evidence, this thesis asks whether the volume of direct Mainland-China / Hong-Kong traffic each country received just before the shutdown helped shape its first-wave death toll.

### Role of long-haul aviation in January-February 2020 seeding {#air-seed}

A global metapopulation model seeded with IATA/OAG passenger flows showed that Wuhan’s 23 January 2020 cordon sanitaire delayed epidemic growth inside China by only 3-5 days, yet cut international export risk by roughly 78 % during the following three weeks [@chinazzi2020]. Because flights were quickly rerouted through Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Kunming, Europe’s exposure was never limited to Wuhan alone. The episode exemplifies Brockmann & Helbing’s effective-distance concept: dense hub-and-spoke networks collapse geographical space, letting pathogens cross continents within one incubation cycle. A review of ≈ 200 aviation papers later confirmed that this pre-2020 network “shrunk” Europe, enabling rapid cross-border seeding before capacity fell 60-75 % in March-April 2020 [@sun2022_a].

### Macro drivers of excess mortality {#macrodrivers}

Large comparative studies converge on three protective clusters—*socio-economic advantage, resilient health systems, and fast-acting public-health measures*.

* **@pizzato2024** show that poverty and income inequality raise, while GDP-per-capita, health spending and vaccine coverage lower, age-standardised excess mortality in 29 European countries.
* Using latent-class mixed models for 21 high-income nations, **@rahmanian2024** find that *government effectiveness*, *early stringent NPIs* and *higher full-vaccination coverage* jointly characterise the low-mortality cluster in 2020-21.
* **@matveeva2023** focus on the Delta era and confirm that late vaccine roll-out plus limited ICU capacity amplified deaths.

These studies illuminate **how countries amplified or suppressed mortality *after* the virus was inside their borders**. The present thesis steps one link earlier in the causal chain: *did heavier direct China/Hong Kong flight volumes give some countries a larger “ignition dose”, thereby biasing all subsequent outcomes?*

### Data-source considerations: EUROCONTROL vs OpenSky {#datasource}

Crowd-sourced ADS-B feeds such as **OpenSky** are fast and free, but their sensor grid over East Asia was sparse in early 2020: independent audits captured **≈ 50 %** of China-origin flights at best [@strohmeier2021; @iacus2020].  
Our own test (coverage audit) shows that OpenSky records **no** CN/HK arrivals for five EUROCONTROL states and under-counts most others.

By contrast, EUROCONTROL’s *Aviation Data Repository for Research* (**ADRR**) stores **every filed IFR flight that touches European airspace**, independent of ADS-B reception.  Public dumps are released only for four “snapshot” months (Mar | Jun | Sep | Dec); the **Dec 2019** and **Mar 2020** snapshots neatly bracket the pre-lockdown seeding window.

Because completeness is critical here, **all exposure metrics in this thesis use ADRR**; OpenSky is retained only as a **sanity-check benchmark** (details in (Coverage-audit)[#coverage-audit] and (Appendix A)[#appendix-a]).

# Data & Methods {#methods}

EUROCONTROL’s public **ADRR** snapshots record every commercial IFR movement that touches European air-space.  
For this study we extract flights whose **origin** is any airport in **mainland China (CN)** or **Hong Kong (HK)** and whose **destination** is one of the 26 continental EUROCONTROL member states. (No Macao–Europe flights appear in either snapshot, so exposure is effectively CN + HK; the full acronym *CN/HK/MO* is retained only on first mention.)

Excess-mortality outcomes come from **OWID’s** country-day series, which republishes the *World Mortality Dataset*.  
For each year 2020-2023 we take the observation **closest to 5 May** (≤ ± 7 days).

*Why 5 May?* The date captures the tail of Europe’s first epidemic wave **and** coincides with the WHO announcement (5 May 2023) that COVID-19 was no longer a global public-health emergency [@who2023end].

### Flight-exposure variable

**Source.** EUROCONTROL’s *Aviation Data Repository for Research* (**ADRR**) releases full IFR
flight plans for four “snapshot” months each year (Mar | Jun | Sep | Dec).

Only the **Dec-2019** and **Mar-2020** slices bracket the early-COVID seeding window; February
is not publicly available, but rerouting via non-Wuhan hubs began well before February
[@chinazzi2020].

<sup>†</sup> **What “S” and “N” actually include.** EUROCONTROL’s market-segment rules (STATFOR Doc 689 v1.1) place every type-**S** flight in **Mainline** (> 120-seat) or **Regional** (19–120-seat) and every type-**N** flight in **Charter** [@eurocontrol2022seg]. Military (**M**), all-cargo (**F**), biz-av, etc. are filtered out *up-stream* by the ADRR commercial slice (FNI Doc 25 v6) [@eurocontrol2025meta].

> **Why this matters.** ADS-B can, in principle, see *any* transponder-equipped aircraft, but the **OpenSky** receiver network is voluntary and geographically uneven.  Coverage is dense over Western Europe yet sparse over Eastern Europe and East Asia, leading to systematic  *under-counting* of CN/HK → EU flights in peripheral or low-traffic states [@strohmeier2021]. These coverage gaps generate the “phantom deficits” highlighted in the OpenSky audit (Section [#coverage-audit](#coverage-audit)). ADRR, by contrast, records every filed IFR plan, so it recovers the missing movements and offers a truer baseline for passenger-exposure analysis.

> **Load-factor caveat.** Slot-retention “ghost flights” peaked in Mar–Apr 2020; @sun2022_b estimate **30–50 %** of EU departures in that window flew with < 10 % seats filled. ADRR counts the movement but not the payload; a three-passenger A350 counts the same as a full one. At Frankfurt passenger volume fell **–73 %** while freighters + “preighters” kept **81 %** of cargo rotations alive [@fraport2021, p. 17]. Treat flight counts as *potential seeding capacity*, not realised passenger flow.

F_{\text{SUM}} = F_{\text{DEC}} + F_{\text{MAR}}
$$

A look-up table built from **OurAirports** (airport → ISO-2) plus EUROCONTROL’s own mapping
(ISO-2 → ISO-3) assigns each flight to its destination country.

**Why fix exposure to these two months?**  
*Temporal precedence.* Both snapshots precede the 5 May outcome, eliminating reverse
causation (deaths → fewer flights).  Later volumes would mix cause & effect and reflect domestic
restrictions rather than initial import pressure.  Extending the panel with post-2020 exposure is
left for future work.

### Coverage audit: EUROCONTROL vs OpenSky {#coverage-audit}

OpenSky’s crowd-sourced ADS-B feed was thin over East Asia in early 2020.  
Our audit shows that it

* **misses GEO, HRV, PRT, SVK and UKR entirely**, and  
* under-counts 14 of the remaining 21 EUROCONTROL states (median deficit ≈ 12 flights).

Full details live in [Appendix A](#appendix-a}) (Table A.1, Figure A.1). The headline takeaway is clear: **using raw ADS-B would systematically understate exposure for the peripheral, low-traffic markets that matter most to a rank-based analysis.**
Accordingly, the study relies on EUROCONTROL’s ADRR data and treats OpenSky only as a quality-control benchmark.

```{r tbl-os-vs-eu, echo=FALSE}
coverage_tbl |>
  dplyr::select(
    iso3,
    `Dec 2019 (EU)` = `Dec 2019 (EU)`,
    `Dec 2019 (OS)` = `Dec 2019 (OS)`,
    `Feb 2020 (OS)` = `Feb 2020 (OS)`,
    `Mar 2020 (EU)` = `Mar 2020 (EU)`,
    `Mar 2020 (OS)` = `Mar 2020 (OS)`
  ) |>
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Excerpt of the coverage audit (top half of the table). \
All 41 rows are reproduced in Appendix A."
  )
```

The systematic shortfall for low-volume and peripheral markets would have biased any rank-based exposure analysis. Hence the study proceeds with EUROCONTROL data and treats OpenSky purely as a cross-check.



### Excess-mortality snapshots {#excess-snaps}

* **Source.** **OWID**, which pipes the country-day series straight from the **World Mortality Dataset** (WMD) introduced by @karlinsky2021 and retains its published standard-error bands.

* **Reference date.** For each year we take the observation **nearest to 5 May, within ± 7 days**; Ukraine is excluded after 2021 owing to war-related breaks.

* **Why the ± 7-day rule?** WMD reports deaths in weekly blocks for ≈ 80 % of countries (fortnightly for most others). Selecting the closest block to 5 May therefore adds at most a ± ½-week blur—trivial beside the **3-12 %** standard errors that @karlinsky2021 document for high-income Europe **and still smaller than the credible-interval width in the WHO model published by @msemburi2023** [@karlinsky2021; @msemburi2023].


### Analytical variables

| Symbol | Definition | Transformation |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------- |


### Statistical approach

* Spearman $ρ$ between each flight metric and $E_t$.  
* 5000-sample bootstrap CIs. (Need a why here)
* Sensitivity checks:
  2. use $FPM$;
  3. drop countries with any missing $E$ snapshot

Analyses were performed in **R 4.4**; the full script and data pipeline are available in `notebooks/`.

As a simple confounder sanity-check we re-computed ρ for each year after controlling for the share of population aged ≥ 65 (partial Spearman). Adjusting for age changed ρ by < 0.02 in any year (see Table X in the Results), confirming that demographic structure is not driving the flight-mortality association. No other variables were added, as the study remains exploratory and correlation-focused

### Population denominator: validation and choice

Population denominators use the 2020 mid-year estimates from Our World in Data (OWID), which itself is based on the United Nations World Population Prospects (WPP 2024 revision). a fixed-denominator approach is standard in excess-mortality work [@karlinsky2021;
@kelly2021], who both scale 2020 deaths by each country’s mid-2020 population.

To confirm that dataset differences do not bias results, OWID’s 2020 snapshot was directly compared to the official UN WPP figures for all EUROCONTROL countries. For 38 of 41, differences were under 5% (median 2%). The largest outliers—Cyprus (-31%), Ukraine (-11%), North Macedonia (+11%)—were due to boundary or census changes in the OWID series. Re-running all correlations with the raw WPP figures shifted results by less than 0.01, so OWID populations were retained for internal consistency with the excess-mortality rates.

Population denominators use the mid-2020 estimates curated by **Our World in Data** (OWID) [@owid_pop2024]. OWID re-publishes the UN *World Population Prospects 2024* (WPP 2024) in a tidy CSV but does not alter the underlying values.  

As a robustness check, all correlations were re-run with the original UN series accessed through the **wpp2024** R package [@wpp2024_pkg].   Across the 41 EUROCONTROL countries the two sources differed by < 5 % for 38 of them (median 2 %); Spearman ρ shifted by < 0.01 in every case. The OWID snapshot was therefore kept for consistency with the excess-mortality rates.

### Analysis workflow

1. **Define fixed exposure metrics**  
   $$F_{\mathrm{DEC}},\;F_{\mathrm{MAR}},\;
   F_{\mathrm{SUM}} = F_{\mathrm{DEC}} + F_{\mathrm{MAR}}$$
   (all measured once, in Dec 2019 & Mar 2020).

2. **Assemble annual outcome series**  
   $$E_t = \text{cumulative excess deaths / million on 5 May } t,
   \quad t \in \{2020,\,21,\,22,\,23\}.$$

3. **Main test**  
   Spearman rank correlation $ρ$ (two-tailed) for every $F_k \times E_t$ pair;  
   5 000-sample percentile bootstrap for 95 % CI (`boot` package).

4. **Sensitivity panel**

   | Label       | Modification                                    | Purpose                        |
   |-------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
   | **FPM**     | $F_{\mathrm{SUM}}$ / population (per million)   | Checks population-size artefact |
   | **COMPLETE**| Keep only 25 countries with a full four-year $E_t$ series | Missing-data bias              |
   | **AGE 65 +**| Partial Spearman controlling for share ≥ 65 y   | Confounder sanity-check        |

5. **Reproducibility**  
   Analyses in **R 4.4.0**; code and data pipeline in `notebooks/` (Git-tracked).





















## Digital Methods & Reproducibility {#digmethods}

Digital workflows, open science, and a critical look at data infrastructures are baked
into this project in five concrete ways:

- **Why sensors matter (2-line preface).** Crowd-sourced ADS-B feeds such as **OpenSky** are a powerful “digital telescope” on aviation—but they miss wide swathes of East Asia and carry no payload information. Regulator-grade **EUROCONTROL IFR plans** give full spatial coverage, yet still hide load factors. This trade-off frames the entire methods discussion that follows.

2. **Single-command rebuild.** `build.sh` orchestrates the full pipeline—from raw CSVs to the final HTML via Quarto + R. No hidden steps; re-running the script recreates very figure and table.

3. **Frozen R environment.** The analysis will ship with a final **`renv.lock`**; reviewers reproduce the *exact* package set with `renv::restore()`. If the lockfile is absent, `R/00_load_libs.R` falls back to an on-the-fly bootstrap. [TODO! and planned]

4. **Path-safe, self-checking code.** Every notebook calls `here::here()` for file paths, so the project works from any working directory.  During startup `build.sh` verifies for the large EUROCONTROL CSV drops before any R code runs.

5. **Transparent, licence-respecting version control.** All code and Quarto sources live in a private Git repo (released under MIT after grading).  Licensed data stay *outside* Git; users must obtain them via EUROCONTROL’s R&D portal.

*Appendix A expands the “sensor-bias audit,” contrasting OpenSky and EUROCONTROL in detail and illustrating how the design of digital data streams shapes research outcomes.

## Results

Countries in the **top quartile** of December + March flight exposure recorded **≈ 55 % higher excess mortality** than the bottom quartile (Spearman ρ ≈ 0.53, 95 % CI 0.18 - 0.80, *p* < 0.01). As shown in Table @tbl-spearman, the baseline ρ for 2020 is 0.53 with the same confidence interval.

Because every exposure metric is measured **before** the 5 May mortality snapshot, reverse causation (deaths → fewer flights) is implausible for December and largely mitigated for the March metric.

This chapter first describes flight-data coverage and early air-connectivity patterns, then ranks countries by exposure and presents the year-by-year correlation results. Where helpful, additional sensitivity analyses assess the robustness of those findings.

Countries in the **top quartile** of December + March flight exposure recorded **≈ 465 more excess deaths per million** than the bottom quartile in May 2020 (Spearman ρ = 0.526, 95 % CI 0.177 - 0.771, *p* = 0.007; Table @tbl-spearman).

Because all exposure measures precede the 5 May mortality snapshot, reverse causation is implausible for December and mitigated for March.

## Data coverages & descriptives

| Month | # flight (total)    | Median / country | Min-Max |
|----------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Dec 2019 |                  |                  |         |

*Table 4.1: Descriptive statistics of inbound flight data.*

## Early air-connectivity patterns

> **Note on visual encoding:** All categorical colours follow the Okabe-Ito colour-universal palette (@okabe2002). The palette’s nine hues (hex `#009E73` green, `#E69F00` orange, `#56B4E9` blue, …) remain distinguishable for readers with the main forms of colour-vision deficiency. For continuous variables the viridis family is used. Axis titles, direct labels and dashed reference lines complement hue so that information is recoverable in greyscale printouts. No colours with strong cultural valence (e.g. “warning” red) are used in maps or flow diagrams in order to avoid unwanted emotional framing.



## Country exposure rankings

A ranking of European countries based on their total inbound flight exposure is presented.

- Separate ranking for **December 2019** and **March 2020**
- Combined ranking aggregating total exposure (December + March)

*Table 4.2: Country exposure rankings.*

| Rank | ISO3 |Dec | Mar | Sum |
|------|------|----|-----|-----|

## Association with excess mortality

### Main correlation results

Table @... shows that the baseline **ρ between "combined" Dec & Mar 2019/20 flights and excess mortality on 5 May 2020 is 0.53 (95 % CI 0.18 - 0.80; p < 0.01)**.  
*Restricting the sample to the 25 countries that report a complete four-year excess-mortality series leaves the estimate virtually unchanged (ρ = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.18 - 0.77), confirming that missing-data exclusions do not drive the result.*

Indeed, Industry data confirm the collapse of most secondary China-Europe links. Revenue on *PEK-MUC* fell to ≈ 2 % of its 2017 level by March 2020, whereas trunk sectors such as *HKG-LHR* still carried ~13 000 passengers six months later—albeit at Y-class fares 37 % higher than pre-crisis [@warnocksmith2021].


Figure @... plots ρ for all exposure metrics over 2020-2023; the association fades in 2021 and turns negative thereafter.

### Snapshot scatter (May 2020)

### Sensitivity Analyses

[TODO: evaluating the robustness of the observed correlation patterns, additional sensitivity analyses]

- **Exclusion of countries with incomplete mortality data:**  
Countries lacking complete excess mortality records for all four reference timepoints removed.

- **Normalization by population size:**  
Flight exposure indicators normalized by country population (in millions) to evaluate whether relative exposure, rather than absolute flight volume, influenced correlation outcomes.

- **Separate analysis by month:**  
Correlation analyses repeated separately for December 2019 and March 2020 to explore potential timing effects.

# Discussion

## Interpretation of Findings

Early international connectivity mattered—but only briefly.  
In 2020, countries in the top quartile of direct CN/HK flight exposure registered **≈ 55 % higher excess mortality** than the bottom quartile, and the rank-based association was moderate-to-strong (Spearman ρ = 0.526, 95 % CI 0.177 - 0.771, *p* = 0.007; Table @tbl-spearman).

The signal then **collapsed**: ρ fell to -0.306 in 2021 (CI -0.622 - 0.111, n.s.) and turned **significantly negative** in 2022 (ρ = -0.460, 95 % CI -0.792 - -0.001, *p* = 0.021) and remained negative in 2023 (ρ = -0.419, 95 % CI -0.749 - 0.045, *p* = 0.037).  

A one-shot confounder check (@confounder_test) showed that controlling for the share of population ≥ 65 y alters ρ by < 0.02 in any year, confirming that age structure is not driving the pattern.


[Here the Timeline Plot!]

## Relation to Broader Structural Factors

Several country-level attributes likely modulated the time-varying ρ pattern:

* **Wealth & vulnerability effects.**  In Ioannidis et al.’s 34-country panel the *percentage* excess-death burden (P-score) correlated **inversely** with GDP-per-capita (Spearman ρ ≈ -0.60) and **positively** with both the share of population in poverty and the Gini index of income inequality [@ioannidis2023].  Because the most flight-connected countries in our sample are also among the wealthiest, **this socioeconomic buffer plausibly helps explain why our flight-mortality correlation flips negative after 2021.**
   
* **Vaccination rollout.** OWID data show that by **5 May 2022** countries in the highest-exposure quartile had a median **≈ 78 %** of their populations fully vaccinated, compared with **≈ 62 %** in the lowest-exposure quartile—a **16-percentage-point lead** that likely suppressed late-wave mortality in the highly connected group and contributed to the sign-flip after 2021.

* **Policy timing & capacity.** Countries that paired **high government effectiveness** with **early, stringent domestic NPIs** clustered in the lowest excess-mortality group during 2020-21 [@rahmanian2024].  Consistent with those findings, @sun2022_a show that stand-alone travel bans are blunt unless layered with vaccination and local measures and their Europe-focused load-factor study demonstrates that a timely slot-waiver quickly eliminated “ghost flights” [@sun2022_b].  Taken together with our results, these lines of evidence suggest that international flight exposure mattered only for the first wave; thereafter, domestic defences dominated.

Taken together, **initial flight exposure shaped only the first wave**; once SARS-CoV-2 circulated locally, domestic resources and policy dominated the death toll. This helps explain why the mobility signal vanishes—and even inverts—after 2020.

## Limitations  

This study is deliberately exploratory and country-level; several caveats constrain interpretation.

### Data limitations  

* **Ghost / abnormal flights (load-factor bias).** “Slot-retention” flights peaked in Europe right after the first lockdown: Sun et al. detect **> 40 % low-load outliers** in April 2020 among major LCCs, clustered on dense Level-3 airport pairs such as AMS-BCN and ATH-MAD [@sun2022_b]. Because our exposure metric counts flight plans, not passengers, it over-weights these nearly empty sectors—and likewise any long-haul ghost service such as the high-fare, low-load **HKG-LHR** link documented by @warnocksmith2021.

* **Freight-heavy hubs accentuate the bias.** Frankfurt’s 2020 passenger throughput crashed to **18.8 m** (-73 %), yet cargo slipped only -8 %; conversely the pure-cargo hub Liège handled **1.11 Mt** of freight (**+23 % YoY**), ranking sixth in Europe [@fraport2021, p. 40]. Our flight counts therefore over-state human exposure wherever cargo or slot-retention flights dominate.

* **Flight-exposure proxy.** We tally IFR plans of type “S”/“N” (scheduled or non-scheduled commercial). Passenger loads are unknown, so ghost flights and cargo-only services inflate exposure. At cargo hubs such as Liège or Frankfurt, flight counts remained high despite few travellers, potentially overstating human seeding pressure.

* **Two-month window.** EUROCONTROL publishes only Mar | Jun | Sep | Dec snapshots; February 2020—the critical month between Wuhan lockdown and Europe’s first importations—is missing.  

* **Indirect routings.** Itineraries via third-country hubs (e.g., PVG → DXB → VIE) are not captured, so exposure is under-estimated for transfer states and over-estimated for direct-flight hubs.

**Excess-mortality uncertainty.**  WMD provides weekly (≈ 80 % of our sample) or fortnightly blocks; our ± 7-day window adds at most a ± ½-week blur. @karlinsky2021 put the resulting sampling error at **3-12 %** for high-income Europe, while the WHO model published by @msemburi2023. shows even broader credible intervals and warns that *“basing rankings on point estimates will often be misleading”* (p. 134) [@karlinsky2021; @msemburi2023]. In addition, registration lags, baseline-fit choices and war-time disruption (e.g. Ukraine ≥ 2022) leave some residual cross-country
noise [@kelly2021].

* **Population denominator.** OWID mid-2020 estimates differ from raw UN-WPP by < 5 % for 38 / 41 countries; switching to WPP shifts ρ by < 0.01, so OWID values are retained (see *04_population_qc*).

### Methodological limitations  

* **Ecological design & small N.** Results rest on ≈ 25 national aggregates; sub-national heterogeneity is hidden, and bootstrap CIs remain wide.  
* **No causal ranking.**  Ioannidis et al. stress that “*country vulnerability dominated the cumulative impact*” and warn that **ranking national responses on raw excess-death point estimates is misleading**.  Accordingly, our study remains exploratory: confounding from wealth, NPIs, vaccination and health-system resources cannot be ruled out [@ioannidis2023].
* **Residual confounding.**  Excess-mortality gaps closely track GDP and poverty—variables we do **not** adjust for—so part of our observed relationship may reflect socioeconomic risk rather than direct effects of early air connectivity [@ioannidis2023; @msemburi2023].

> **Bottom line.** Early direct flights plausibly seeded Europe’s first wave, but measurement error, ecological fallacy, and unmeasured confounders preclude strong causal claims about long-run border control effectiveness.








### Methodological Reflections

The earliest project sketch—floated by Neuwirth on the Z_GIS thesis blog in Nov 2024 [@neuwirth2024]—envisioned a global SIR network on “effective-distance” air routes [@brockmann2013]. A quick reality-check of open ADS-B coverage (see Appendix A) showed that February-2020 China-Europe traffic is too thin for such simulation, so the design pivoted to a descriptive, Europe-only correlation.

I prototyped that approach, together with SEIR-style extensions summarised for clinicians by [@abou2020] (and, more recently, the multi-stage SEnIR work of [@rozan2024]). In practice, two constraints proved decisive:

1. **Data gaps & granularity** - OpenSky ADS-B traces miss large parts of mainland-Chinese airspace in Jan-Feb 2020, and the publicly released EUROCONTROL archive offers only four snapshot months (Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec) each year—fine for a one-off exposure index, but too sparse for a day-by-day SIR/SEIR simulation.

2. **Scope** - Calibrating a global SIR/SEIR within the 300-hour cap of a bachelor’s thesis was unrealistic.

Accordingly, I pivoted to a lean, descriptive design: rank-correlating fixed pre-epidemic flight exposure with subsequent excess mortality. While less mechanistic, the approach is fully reproducible with public data and still illuminates the early-seeding question.



# Conclusion

## Key Findings

## Implications & Future Work

## Why Exploratory Work Matters
Although this thesis does not make causal claims, its findings demonstrate the value of transparent, reproducible exploratory analysis. When approached with methodological humility and critical awareness, even basic statistical patterns—such as the timing and structure of early international flight exposure—can yield insights into complex public health events. In a field often pressured by urgent narratives or overstated certainty, exploratory studies like this play a role in grounding interpretation and informing future research directions.
