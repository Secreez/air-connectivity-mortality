## Introduction

### Context & motivation

When SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019, the global airline network compressed inter-city travel times to hours, not weeks. Modelling studies show that long-haul flights shorten the “effective distance” between outbreak foci and distant populations, speeding the first wave of infections [@chinazzi2020; @sun2022_a].

Yet European countries later displayed wide gaps in excess mortality. Analysts have linked those gaps to demography, health-system capacity, and policy timing [@rahmanian2024; @matveeva2023]. How much of the early mortality spread can be traced to initial exposure via direct flights from China and its two SARs? The question remains largely descriptive—and unanswered.

### Research Question

> Among continental EUROCONTROL member states, is a higher volume of direct inbound flights from China/HongKong/Macao (Dec 2019 & Mar 2020) associated with higher cumulative excess mortality on 5 May 2020?

Snapshots for 2021-2023 are analysed as robustness checks.

### Objectives

**1. Measure exposure:** Create a country-level index of inbound IFR flights (Dec 2019, Mar 2020, sum) from EUROCONTROL data.

**2. Rank & correlate:** Compute Spearman ρ between exposure ranks and excess-mortality ranks on 5 May 2020; repeat for 2021-2023.

**3. Appraise validity:** Discuss strengths and limits of flight counts as a proxy for epidemic seeding.

### Road-map

- Chapter 2 reviews work on mobility-driven seeding and excess-mortality metrics.
- Chapter 3 details data cleaning and the correlation method.
- Chapter 4 presents exposure rankings, maps, and ρ results.
- Chapter 5 interprets the patterns, weighs confounders, and tests sensitivity.
- Chapter 6 summarises key findings and outlines next-step research.

## Literature Review {#litrev}

Recent syntheses (e.g. [@pizzato2024]) show wide cross-country gaps in European excess-mortality and point to socio-economic gradients, health-system capacity and vaccination uptake as major drivers. This thesis adds an early-mobility angle that those studies treat only tangentially.

### Excess mortality as benchmark

[TODO: Brief paragraph: why excess deaths capture the full health burden better than case or COVID-death counts; citation to WMD, HMD-STMF.]

### Mobility-driven seeding

[TODO: One paragraph: network epidemiology concept of “effective distance” [cite Brockmann & Helbing 2013]; empirical links between flight volume and first-wave seeding (e.g. [@chinazzi2020] global; [@sun2022_a] intra-EU).]

### Why EUROCONTROL, not OpenSky

OpenSky’s crowd-sourced ADS-B receivers leave blind spots across East Asia; many CN → EU flights in Dec-19 are simply absent (Appendix Fig X). EUROCONTROL, by contrast, records every IFR movement that crosses its network boundary. For this project the exposure metric is therefore realised flights (EUROCONTROL), not scheduled seats or partial ADS-B traces. OpenSky appears only to illustrate its coverage bias.

[TODO: Create Opensky map again...]

## Data & Methods {#methods}

The EUROCONTROL schedule includes traffic from mainland China (CN), Hong Kong (HK) and Macao (MO).
No Macao–Europe flights appear in December 2019 or March 2020, so subsequent figures refer effectively to CN + HK only. The acronym CN/HK/MO is retained for completeness the first time it is used; thereafter ‘CN/HK’ is shown on axes and captions.

To ensure comparability, excess mortality was measured on or near 5 May of each year (2020–2023), using the closest available OWID data within ±7 days. The use of May is justified both by the timing of the initial European epidemic wave (Spring 2020) and by the World Health Organization's declaration on 5 May 2023 officially ending COVID-19 as a global public health emergency [@who2023end].

This four-year series allows a consistent, annually repeated cross-sectional snapshot of excess mortality from the beginning through the official end of the pandemic.

### Study design

Exploratory, cross-sectional correlation at the *country* level.

Outcome = cumulative excess-deaths / million on 5 May of 2020-23.  

Exposure = direct CN/HK/MO → EUROCONTROL flights in Dec 2019 and Mar 2020.

### Flight-exposure data

Commercial passenger flights were extracted from EUROCONTROL's “Aviation Data Repository for Research”.  
The public archive publishes **only four sample months per year (Mar; Jun; Sep; Dec)**, so **February 2020, the crucial month between Wuhan lockdown and Europe's first local clusters—is unfortunately absent**. 

Filters: ICAO flight types *S* / *N*; ADEP ∈ {CN, HK}; ADES ∈ 26 continental member states.  

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{\text{DEC}} &=\; \text{Flights in Dec 2019}\\
F_{\text{MAR}} &=\; \text{Flights in Mar 2020}\\
F_{\text{SUM}} &=\; F_{\text{DEC}} + F_{\text{MAR}}
\end{aligned}
$$
Geocoding OurAirports → ISO-2; EUROCONTROL map → ISO-3.

Flight exposure is intentionally fixed at these two pre-epidemic months to preserve temporal precedence.^[A time-varying flight metric (e.g. 2021 volumes) was not analysed because this study targets early seeding, not ongoing mobility. Future work could extend the panel with later exposure measures.]

### Excess mortality snapshots

*Source* OWID (WMD + HMD–STMF). 

*Reference date* closest non-NA within **± 7 days of 5 May**; Ukraine excluded after 2021 (data break due to war).

Rationale: The OWID excess-mortality dataset (a combination of WMD and HMD-STMF data sources) does not consistently provide daily observations for all countries. To maintain consistency across EUROCONTROL member countries, a pragmatic ±7-day window around each 5 May reference date was chosen to select the closest available observation. Countries lacking observations within this window—particularly Ukraine after 2021—were excluded from the corresponding yearly correlation analyses.

For every country and year we kept **only the OWID row whose date lay closest to 5 May (tolerance ± 7 days)**.  This pre-selection means that each country
contributes exactly one observation per year, so no further timing‐shift robustness test is necessary.


### Analytical variables

| Symbol | Definition | Transformation |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------- |


### Statistical approach

* Spearman $ρ$ between each flight metric and $E_t$.  
* 5000-sample bootstrap CIs. (Need a why here)
* Sensitivity checks:
  2. use $FPM$;
  3. drop countries with any missing $E$ snapshot

Analyses were performed in **R 4.4**; the full script and data pipeline are available in `notebooks/`.

As a simple confounder sanity-check we re-computed ρ for each year after controlling for the share of population aged ≥ 65 (partial Spearman). Adjusting for age changed ρ by < 0.02 in any year (see Table X in the Results), confirming that demographic structure is not driving the flight–mortality association. No other variables were added, as the study remains exploratory and correlation-focused

### Population denominator: validation and choice

Population denominators use the 2020 mid-year estimates from Our World in Data (OWID), which itself is based on the United Nations World Population Prospects (WPP 2024 revision). This fixed denominator approach is standard for COVID-19 excess-mortality studies [@karlinsky2021; @kelly2021], as European populations vary by less than ±1% year to year.

To confirm that dataset differences do not bias results, OWID’s 2020 snapshot was directly compared to the official UN WPP figures for all EUROCONTROL countries. For 38 of 41, differences were under 5% (median 2%). The largest outliers—Cyprus (–31%), Ukraine (–11%), North Macedonia (+11%)—were due to boundary or census changes in the OWID series. Re-running all correlations with the raw WPP figures shifted results by less than 0.01, so OWID populations were retained for internal consistency with the excess-mortality rates.

### Analysis workflow

1. **Define fixed exposure metrics**  
   $$F_{\mathrm{DEC}},\;F_{\mathrm{MAR}},\;
   F_{\mathrm{SUM}} = F_{\mathrm{DEC}} + F_{\mathrm{MAR}}$$
   (all measured once, in Dec 2019 & Mar 2020).

2. **Assemble annual outcome series**  
   $$E_t = \text{cumulative excess deaths / million on 5 May } t,
   \quad t \in \{2020,\,21,\,22,\,23\}.$$

3. **Main test**  
   Spearman rank correlation $ρ$ (two-tailed) for every $F_k \times E_t$ pair;  
   5 000-sample percentile bootstrap for 95 % CI (`boot` package).

# Results

Countries in the **top quartile** of December + March flight exposure recorded **≈ 55 % higher excess mortality** than the bottom quartile (Spearman ρ ≈ 0.53, 95 % CI 0.18 – 0.80, *p* < 0.01). As shown in Table @tbl-spearman, the baseline ρ for 2020 is 0.53 with the same confidence interval.

Because every exposure metric is measured **before** the 5 May mortality snapshot, reverse causation (deaths → fewer flights) is implausible for December and largely mitigated for the March metric.

This chapter first describes flight-data coverage and early air-connectivity patterns, then ranks countries by exposure and presents the year-by-year correlation results. Where helpful, additional sensitivity analyses assess the robustness of those findings.

Countries in the **top quartile** of December + March flight exposure recorded **≈ 465 more excess deaths per million** than the bottom quartile in May 2020 (Spearman ρ = 0.526, 95 % CI 0.177 – 0.771, *p* = 0.007; Table @tbl-spearman).


Because all exposure measures precede the 5 May mortality snapshot, reverse causation is implausible for December and mitigated for March.

## Early air-connectivity patterns

> **Note on visual encoding:** All categorical colours follow the Okabe–Ito colour-universal palette (@okabe2002). The palette’s nine hues (hex `#009E73` green, `#E69F00` orange, `#56B4E9` blue, …) remain distinguishable for readers with the main forms of colour-vision deficiency. For continuous variables the viridis family is used. Axis titles, direct labels and dashed reference lines complement hue so that information is recoverable in greyscale printouts. No colours with strong cultural valence (e.g. “warning” red) are used in maps or flow diagrams in order to avoid unwanted emotional framing.

[Notes for Figures]
4.1. Stack two coloured bars per country (legend “Dec / Mar”). Order by Dec count so the drop is obvious. - example: “Inbound CN/HK/MO → EU flights (IFR), top-15 destinations.”
4.2. Flow graphic – Shows who flew to whom; gives geographical intuition that a plain bar cannot. - If Sankyey, cleaner for volumes, but beware Variables.
4.3 Choropleth (per-country totals, same palette).
4.4. Daily flight profile within each sample month - Demonstrates intra-month variability (e.g. the steep drop after 15 Mar). - Two separate facets: “Dec 2019” and “Mar 2020” - Bar on thin line; y-axis = flights/day. - Insert grey panel: “No data Jan–Feb 2020” between facets

## Country exposure rankings

A ranking of European countries based on their total inbound flight exposure is presented.

- Combined ranking aggregating total exposure (December + March)

## Association with excess mortality

### Main correlation results

Table @... shows that the baseline **ρ between "combined" Dec & Mar 2019/20 flights and excess mortality on 5 May 2020 is 0.53 (95 % CI 0.18 – 0.80; p < 0.01)**.  
*Restricting the sample to the 25 countries that report a complete four-year excess-mortality series leaves the estimate virtually unchanged (ρ = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.18 – 0.77), confirming that missing-data exclusions do not drive the result.*

Figure @... plots ρ for all exposure metrics over 2020-2023; the association fades in 2021 and turns negative thereafter.

### Sensitivity Analyses

[TODO: evaluating the robustness of the observed correlation patterns, additional sensitivity analyses]

- **Exclusion of countries with incomplete mortality data:**  
Countries lacking complete excess mortality records for all four reference timepoints removed.

- **Normalization by population size:**  
Flight exposure indicators normalized by country population (in millions) to evaluate whether relative exposure, rather than absolute flight volume, influenced correlation outcomes.

- **Separate analysis by month:**  
Correlation analyses repeated separately for December 2019 and March 2020 to explore potential timing effects. ->

The following chapter discusses these findings in the broader context of structural factors and methodological considerations














## Discussion

### Interpretation of Findings

Early international connectivity mattered—but only briefly.  
In 2020, countries in the top quartile of direct CN/HK flight exposure registered **≈ 55 % higher excess mortality** than the bottom quartile, and the rank-based association was moderate-to-strong (Spearman ρ = 0.526, 95 % CI 0.177 – 0.771, *p* = 0.007; Table @tbl-spearman).

The signal then **collapsed**: ρ fell to –0.306 in 2021 (CI –0.622 – 0.111, n.s.) and turned **significantly negative** in 2022 (ρ = –0.460, 95 % CI –0.792 – –0.001, *p* = 0.021) and remained negative in 2023 (ρ = –0.419, 95 % CI –0.749 – 0.045, *p* = 0.037).  

A one-shot confounder check (@confounder_test) showed that controlling for the share of population ≥ 65 y alters ρ by < 0.02 in any year, confirming that age structure is not driving the pattern.

### Relation to Broader Structural Factors

Several country-level attributes likely modulated the time-varying ρ pattern:

* **Wealth and health-system capacity.** Cross-country studies show that higher GDP per capita and stronger hospital capacity were associated with *lower* late-pandemic mortality [@ioannidis2023]. Because the most flight-connected countries are also among the wealthiest, these advantages plausibly explain part of the negative ρ observed after 2021.

* **Vaccination rollout.** OWID data show that by May 2022 most high-flight countries had fully vaccinated ≥ 70 % of their populations, several months ahead of the low-flight quartile (which was still below 60 %). Earlier and broader vaccine coverage would have suppressed late-wave deaths in the highly connected group, contributing to the sign-flip after 2021.

* **Public-health response.** Stringency-timing work (e.g. [@rahmanian2024]) finds that early, coordinated NPIs shaved first-wave deaths. Several low-flight Nordic states locked down rapidly and later reopened cautiously, narrowing the mortality gap despite low exposure.

Taken together, **initial flight exposure shaped only the first wave**; once SARS-CoV-2 circulated locally, domestic resources and policy dominated the death toll. This helps explain why the mobility signal vanishes—and even inverts—after 2020.




### Limitations  

This study is deliberately exploratory and country-level; several caveats constrain interpretation.

#### Data limitations  

* **Flight-exposure proxy.** We count IFR flight plans of type “S”/“N” (scheduled or non-scheduled commercial). Passenger loads are unknown, so “ghost” flights and cargo-only services inflate exposure. At cargo hubs such as Liège or Frankfurt, flight counts remained high despite few travellers, potentially overstating human seeding pressure.  

* **Two-month window.** EUROCONTROL publishes only Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec snapshots; February 2020—the critical month between Wuhan lockdown and Europe’s first importations—is missing.  

* **Indirect routings.** Itineraries via third-country hubs (e.g. PVG → DXB → VIE) are not captured, so exposure is under-estimated for transfer states and over-estimated for direct-flight hubs.  

* **Excess-mortality uncertainty.** OWID’s WMD + HMD-STMF blend carries wide CIs; registration lags and modelling choices vary by country [@karlinsky2021; @msemburi2023]. We mitigate timing noise by selecting the nearest value within ± 7 days of 5 May each year (see: 01_excess_snapshots).  

* **Population denominator.** OWID mid-2020 estimates differ from raw UN-WPP by < 5 % for 38 / 41 countries; switching to WPP shifts ρ by < 0.01, so OWID values are retained. (see: 04_population_qc)

#### Methodological limitations  

* **Ecological design & small N.** Results rest on ≈ 25 national aggregates; sub-national heterogeneity is hidden, and bootstrap CIs remain wide.  
* **No causal inference.** Temporal ordering reduces, but does not abolish, confounding: wealth, healthcare capacity, NPIs, and vaccination likely shaped mortality patterns [@ioannidis2023].  
* **Residual confounding.** Only one sanity-check control (age ≥ 65 y) was tested; GDP pc, vaccination coverage, or stringency indices could be explored in future work.

> **Bottom line.** Early direct flights plausibly seeded Europe’s first wave, but measurement error, ecological fallacy, and unmeasured confounders preclude strong causal claims about long-run border control effectiveness.








### Methodological Reflections

Early versions of this research design included dynamic modeling approaches such as a network-based SIR simulation [@brockmann2013] or SEIR extensions [@abou2020; @rozan2024]. However, incomplete flight records for January–February 2020, combined with uneven global data coverage and the practical time constraints of a Bachelor's thesis (~300 hours), rendered such approaches infeasible. A simplified, descriptive correlation analysis was chosen to maintain feasibility and transparency while stillallowing meaningful insights into early pandemic exposure patterns.

## Conclusion

### Key Findings

### Implications & Future Work

### Why Exploratory Work Matters
Although this thesis does not make causal claims, its findings demonstrate the value of transparent, reproducible exploratory analysis. When approached with methodological humility and critical awareness, even basic statistical patterns—such as the timing and structure of early international flight exposure—can yield insights into complex public health events. In a field often pressured by urgent narratives or overstated certainty, exploratory studies like this play a role in grounding interpretation and informing future research directions.
