abstract: We test whether direct long-haul exposure to China/Hong Kong just before Europe’s COVID-19 shutdown helps explain first-wave excess mortality. Using EUROCONTROL’s Aviation Data Repository for Research (ADRR), we count inbound IFR passenger flights from Mainland China and Hong Kong in December 2019 and March 2020 across 25 continental EUROCONTROL states ( $F_{\text{DEC}}, F_{\text{MAR}}, F_{\text{SUM}}$ ). Outcomes are excess deaths per million on 5 May in 2020–2023 (nearest value ±7 days; Our World in Data / World Mortality Dataset). A coverage audit shows that community ADS-B (OpenSky) undercounts CN/HK → Europe-25 arrivals, so ADRR provides exposure while OpenSky is used only for QC. In 2020, exposure is positively associated with excess mortality (Spearman $\rho = 0.526$; 95% CI 0.177–0.771; $p = 0.007$); the top exposure quartile recorded ≈ 465 more deaths per million than the bottom quartile. The association weakens toward zero in 2021 and reverses in 2022 (negative and significant), remaining negative in 2023 with a 95% CI that includes zero. Limitations include the missing February ADRR snapshot, lack of passenger-load information (“ghost flights”), and unobserved multi-leg itineraries.

# Introduction

## Context & motivation

On **31 December 2019**, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported a cluster of “viral pneumonia of unknown aetiology”; WHO issued its first Disease Outbreak News five days later [@who2022timeline]. Europe’s first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected on **24 January 2020** in France [@spiteri2020]. By **21–23 February 2020**, Italy had reported its **first COVID-19 death** and **rapidly expanding local-transmission clusters** centred on **Lombardy**, with additional cases in **Veneto, Piedmont, and Emilia-Romagna**; **ECDC** assessed the risk of **similar clusters elsewhere in the EU/EEA and UK** as **moderate to high** [@ecdcitaly2020].

The six-week hop from Wuhan to Northern Italy shows how long-haul aviation can relocate a pathogen within a single generation interval. A global metapopulation model estimated that Wuhan’s **23 January** cordon sanitaire delayed local growth by only **3–5 days**, yet reduced *international* exportations by roughly **78 %** through mid-February [@chinazzi2020]. A **review of nearly 200** studies on COVID-19 and air transport concludes that dense pre-2020 flight networks **shrank** Europe, enabling rapid cross-border seeding before the March–April capacity collapse [@sun2022_a].

Excess-mortality outcomes diverged sharply thereafter. A latent-class mixed-model analysis of **21 countries** found **COVID-19 incidence** (lagged) to be the strongest positive correlate of excess mortality, while **vaccination** and **policy stringency** (via interactions with incidence) were negatively associated with excess mortality (not always statistically significant across clusters). **Government revenue** and **government effectiveness** were among the most protective structural factors; the lower-mortality cluster also had higher **life expectancy/HAQ/UHC** [@rahmanian2024].

This thesis asks how much of Europe’s first-wave mortality spread is associated with a country’s **direct-flight exposure to Mainland China and Hong Kong** just before lockdowns.

**Provenance & scope.** The project was initially conceived as a global, networked SIR exercise in the spirit of @brockmann2013 seeded in Wuhan and driven by early-2020 air-mobility data. After scoping, two constraints made that infeasible at bachelor scale—the commercial cost of global FR24 history and **East Asia** coverage gaps in community ADS-B (OpenSky). We therefore pivoted early to **EUROCONTROL ADRR** and built **Dec-2019 / Mar-2020** exposure measures for EUROCONTROL states, testing rank associations with **OWID/WMD** excess-mortality snapshots. The **February 2020** ADRR gap is noted as a limitation.

## Research question

> Among the **continental EUROCONTROL states**, is a higher volume of **direct inbound flights** from Mainland China/Hong Kong in **Dec 2019** and **Mar 2020** associated with higher cumulative **excess mortality** on **5 May 2020**?^[Macao appears in the initial CN/HK/MO acronym but shows **zero** Europe-bound flights in the EUROCONTROL snapshots used here; analyses therefore refer to CN/HK. See [Methods](#methods).]

## Objectives


1. **Measure exposure:** Build a country-level index of inbound IFR flights (Dec 2019, Mar 2020, and their sum) from EUROCONTROL ADRR.
2. **Rank & correlate:** Compute Spearman **ρ** between exposure ranks and excess-mortality ranks on 5 May 2020; repeat for 2021–2023.
3. **Assess validity:** Discuss strengths and limitations of flight counts as a proxy for epidemic seeding.

## Road map

- **Chapter 2** reviews mobility-driven seeding and macro determinants of excess mortality.
- **Chapter 3** details data cleaning and correlation methods.
- **Chapter 4** presents results.
- **Chapter 5** interprets findings and runs sensitivity checks.
- **Chapter 6** summarises key points and outlines next-step research.

# Literature Review {#litrev}

Recent syntheses—most recently @pizzato2024—map socio-economic and vaccination gradients in Europe’s excess mortality but give little attention to **importation pathways**. This thesis adds an early-mobility lens.

## Excess mortality as benchmark

Official COVID-19 death tallies are sensitive to testing capacity and certification rules. In 35 countries, @kelly2021 contrasted reported COVID-19 deaths with excess-death estimates based on a *fixed 2020 population denominator* and showed large cross-country discrepancies, concluding that “published COVID-19 death data are **not directly comparable across countries**.” This motivates excess mortality—scaled to a single mid-year population—as a more robust yardstick.

Because this thesis tracks excess mortality **at the same calendar cut-off (5 May) for four consecutive years**, each snapshot captures the tail of Europe’s spring wave while avoiding later seasonal confounders (see [Methods](#methods)).

## Mobility-driven seeding

Wuhan’s **23 January 2020** cordon sanitaire delayed—but did not prevent—international spread: even a **90 %** air-traffic cut mainly *postponed* transmission unless local contact rates also fell [@chinazzi2020]. This aligns with the “effective-distance” view that hub-and-spoke aviation collapses geography, allowing pathogens to traverse continents within a single incubation cycle [@brockmann2013]. A review of ≈ 200 studies confirms that the pre-2020 flight network enabled rapid intra-EU seeding before capacity fell **60–75 %** in March–April 2020 [@sun2022_a].

**This study tests whether the volume of direct Mainland-China/Hong-Kong flights just before the shutdown helps explain countries’ first-wave excess deaths.**

### January–February 2020: long-haul seeding in practice {#air-seed}

Passenger flows were quickly re-routed via non-Wuhan mainland hubs (e.g., PVG, PEK, CAN, KMG, SZX), so Europe’s exposure was never limited to Wuhan alone [@chinazzi2020]. In effective-distance terms, dense intercontinental links compressed travel times enough for seeding well inside a generation interval [@brockmann2013], with the pre-2020 network doing the heavy lifting before the March collapse [@sun2022_a].

### Macro drivers of excess mortality {#macrodrivers}

Large comparative studies converge on three protective clusters—**socio-economic advantage, resilient health systems, and fast-acting public-health measures**:

* @pizzato2024: Poverty/inequality raise, while GDP per capita, health spending, and vaccine coverage lower, age-standardised excess mortality (29 European countries).
* @rahmanian2024: Low-mortality class combines government effectiveness, early stringent NPIs, and higher full-vaccination coverage (21 high-income countries, 2020–21).
* @matveeva2023: During Delta, late vaccine roll-out plus limited ICU capacity amplified deaths.

These speak to **amplification after importation**. The present thesis steps one link earlier: did heavier **direct CN/HK flight volumes** give some countries a larger “ignition dose”?

### Data-source considerations: EUROCONTROL vs OpenSky {#datasource}

Community ADS-B coverage is uneven. OpenSky’s 2019 archive lists **≈ 31.0 million** flights—**≈ 45%** of the **68.95 million** flights tracked by Flightradar24 that year—with much stronger reception over Western **Europe** than East Asia; because FR24 also uses non-ADS-B sources, **45%** is an **upper-bound** comparison. [@strohmeier2021]

For early-2020 **CN/HK → Europe-25** links (our 25 continental EUROCONTROL states), this matters: in our audit OpenSky records **zero** arrivals for five states and **undercounts** most others relative to EUROCONTROL. (See Appendix @tbl-os-vs-eu-full; @fig-opensky-bar.)

By contrast, EUROCONTROL’s *Aviation Data Repository for Research* (**ADRR**) contains **filed IFR flight plans in the EUROCONTROL Network Manager area**, independent of ADS-B reception. Public snapshots exist for **Mar | Jun | Sep | Dec**; **Dec 2019** and **Mar 2020** bracket the pre-lockdown seeding window used here.

# Data & Methods {#methods}

EUROCONTROL’s public **ADRR** snapshots contain all filed **IFR** flight plans that touch **European Network Manager airspace**. We keep flights whose origin is any airport in **Mainland China (CN)** or **Hong Kong (HK)** and whose destination is one of **25 continental EUROCONTROL states**. (No Macao–Europe flights appear in either snapshot; exposure is effectively CN + HK. The full acronym *CN/HK/MO* is used only on first mention.)

Excess-mortality outcomes come from **Our World in Data’s (OWID)** COVID-19 country-day series, which republishes the **World Mortality Dataset (WMD)**.
For each of **2020–2023**, we take the observation **closest to 5 May** (±7 days).

*Why 5 May?* This date captures the tail of Europe’s first epidemic wave and, for 2023, coincides with WHO’s end-of-emergency announcement [@who2023end].

### Statistical approach

* **Association.** Spearman’s ρ between each flight metric and $E_t$.
* **Uncertainty.** 95 % percentile-bootstrap CIs (5,000 draws; seed = 42). [@diciccio1996]
* **Sensitivity.**
  1. replace $F_{\text{SUM}}$ with $FPM$ (population-scaled);
  2. restrict to countries with a **complete four-year $E_t$ series**;
  3. compute **partial Spearman** controlling for the share of population ≥ 65 (rank-residualisation; see code).
* **Inference stance.** Two-sided tests; $\alpha=0.05$. Given the exploratory aim, **no multiple-testing correction** is applied; emphasis is on effect sizes and CIs.

**Software.** Analyses were conducted in **R 4.4.0** [@R-base]; the full, reproducible pipeline is scripted in `R/`.

A [confounder sanity-check](#tbl-sensitivity) showed that adjusting for age ≥ 65 changed $\rho$ by **< 0.02** in any year, so no further covariates were added (exploratory, correlation-focused study). We did **not** model vaccination, NPIs, GDP or other covariates; any mentions in the Discussion are descriptive context rather than part of the statistical tests.

### Snapshot source {#snapshot-source}

EUROCONTROL’s **ADRR** publishes full **IFR** datasets for four “snapshot” months per year (**Mar | Jun | Sep | Dec**). Only **Dec 2019** and **Mar 2020** straddle the early-COVID seeding period; **February 2020 is not publicly available**. By mid-January, flows had already re-routed via non-Wuhan mainland hubs.

#### What **S / N** cover

Under **STATFOR 2022** rules (retro-applied to 2019), **S** (scheduled passenger) splits into **Regional** (scheduled flights on **19–120-seat** aircraft types) and **Mainline** (other scheduled, typically **> 120 seats**); **N** maps to **Charter** (helicopters moved to “Other”). Priority rules assign **Military** first, then **Business Aviation**, to avoid misclassification. [@eurocontrol2022seg]

#### Why ADRR over community ADS-B

OpenSky captured **≈ 45%** of FR24’s 2019 flights and is geographically skewed toward Western Europe, so raw ADS-B **undercounts** **CN/HK → Europe-25** exposure, including **zeros** for several states in our window. **ADRR** records **all filed IFR** in the EUROCONTROL NM area, recovering movements missed by ADS-B and providing a more reliable exposure baseline [@strohmeier2021]. (See [Coverage audit](#coverage-audit).)

#### Load-factor caveat (movement ≠ passengers)

A panel of **24 European airlines** shows **large shares of statistically “abnormal”** (low-load) flights in **Mar–Apr 2020**, receding through 2021; “abnormal” is defined **statistically** (IQR outliers), **not** as “< 10% seats filled” [@sun2022_b]. **ADRR counts movements, not load**—a three-passenger A350 counts the same as a full one. At Frankfurt, passenger volume fell $-73%$ in 2020, while **freighters carried ≈80%** of cargo tonnage (peaking **> 90%** in Apr–May) and airlines operated **≈ 8,600 preighter flights** (**> 150 kt**, **≈ 8%** of cargo tonnage). Treat $F$ as **potential seeding capacity**, not realised traveller volume [@fraport2021].


$$
F_{\text{DEC}}=\text{CN/HK}\rightarrow\text{Europe-25 flights in Dec 2019},\\
F_{\text{MAR}}=\text{CN/HK}\rightarrow\text{Europe-25 flights in Mar 2020},\\
F_{\text{SUM}}=F_{\text{DEC}}+F_{\text{MAR}}
$$

Flights are assigned to destination countries using **OurAirports** (airport → ISO-2) and EUROCONTROL’s ISO-2 → ISO-3 mapping.

### Why fix exposure to Dec 2019 & Mar 2020?

**Temporal precedence.** Both snapshots precede the **5 May** outcome dates, limiting reverse causation (deaths → fewer flights). Later months mostly reflect domestic restrictions rather than initial import pressure. Extending exposure windows beyond 2020 is left for future work.

*(Code in `R/`; processed tables in `data/processed/`.)*

## Coverage audit — EUROCONTROL vs OpenSky {#coverage-audit}

**Purpose.** Test whether community ADS-B (OpenSky) undercounts **direct CN/HK → Europe-25** arrivals in **Dec 2019 / Feb 2020 / Mar 2020**.

**Finding.** OpenSky is thin over **East Asia** and parts of **Eastern Europe** in early 2020:
* **Misses entirely:** `GEO, HRV, PRT, SVK, UKR` (no CN/HK arrivals recorded in our window).
* **Undercounts:** 14 of the remaining 21 states vs **ADRR** (typical shortfall **≈ a dozen flights** in the Dec-2019 baseline).

(Full country-by-country comparisons in Appendix @tbl-os-vs-eu-full; see also @fig-opensky-bar for the erratic month-to-month pattern.)

**How OpenSky defines a “flight.”** A “flight” is a derived ADS-B trajectory: **≥ 15 min** continuous contact; segments are **split after > 10 min** gaps unless a kinematic check reconnects them; origin/destination may be **NULL** if the last seen point is **> 2,500 m** altitude or **> 10 km** from any airport. These rules can miss oceanic/peripheral segments and sometimes misassign ADEP/ADES. [@strohmeier2021]

**Consequence.** Because crowdsourced ADS-B systematically understates exposure for peripheral markets, we use **ADRR** for all exposure metrics (filed IFR in the **EUROCONTROL NM area**) and **OpenSky only as a QC benchmark**. [@strohmeier2021]

## Excess-mortality snapshots {#excess-snaps}

**Why ±7 days?** Most WMD series (as republished by OWID) are **weekly** (some **fortnightly** or **monthly**). Picking the observation **nearest to 5 May (±7 days)** keeps countries aligned within **one reporting interval** and avoids artefacts from different week cut-offs. For monthly reporters, the rule collapses to the same month snapshot. [@karlinsky2021; @mathieu2021owidvaccinations]

## Population denominator — validation & choice

We use OWID’s **mid-2020 population** (UN **WPP 2024** reprint), following the fixed-denominator convention in excess-mortality work [@karlinsky2021; @kelly2021].

**QC against raw UN WPP (via `wpp2024`):**

* **38 / 41** country values differ by **< 5 %** (median **2 %**).
* Largest gaps: **CYP −31 %**, **UKR −11 %**, **MKD +11 %** (boundary/census updates).
* Re-running correlations with UN figures shifts Spearman **ρ by < 0.01**.

We therefore keep OWID’s mid-2020 values for **consistency** with the excess-mortality numerator.
(Details: `04_population_qc.R`.)

## Analysis workflow

1. **Define exposure metrics**

   $$
     F_{\text{DEC}},\;F_{\text{MAR}},\quad
     F_{\text{SUM}}=F_{\text{DEC}}+F_{\text{MAR}}.
   $$

2. **Assemble outcome series**

   $$
     E_t=\text{excess deaths per million on 5 May of year }t,\quad t\in\{2020,2021,2022,2023\}.
   $$

3. **Main test**
   Spearman ρ with **95 % bootstrap CIs** (5 000 draws) for each $F_k \times E_t$.

4. **Sensitivity panel**

   | Label        | Modification                               | Purpose                 |
   | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
   | **FPM**      | Scale exposure by population               | Size artefact check     |
   | **COMPLETE** | Keep only countries with full 4-year $E_t$ | Missing-data bias       |
   | **AGE 65+**  | Partial Spearman (control % aged ≥ 65)     | Confounder sanity-check |

5. **Reproducibility**
   Code, data, and rendered Quarto reports are version-tracked; a single `build.sh` rebuilds everything from raw inputs.

### Visual encoding & accessibility {#viz-note}

All plots use the **Okabe–Ito** colour-universal palette [@okabe2008]. Direct labels, clear axis titles, and dashed reference lines ensure legibility in greyscale and for common colour-vision deficiencies. We avoid high-valence hues (e.g., “alarming red”) to limit framing bias.

## Digital methods & reproducibility {#digmethods}

**Reproducibility.** The analysis is fully scripted and rebuildable: from a clean clone (with required raw inputs), one command runs the data prep, analysis, and rendering end-to-end.

* 1. **Know the data infrastructure.** Two complementary sources are used: community ADS-B (**OpenSky**) with uneven East-Asian coverage and no load factors, and regulator-grade IFR plans (**EUROCONTROL ADRR**) with complete European coverage (also no passenger counts). Mapping each stream’s blind spots (see [Coverage audit](#coverage-audit)) is part of the method.
* 2. **Single-command rebuild.** A Bash wrapper `build.sh` orchestrates the pipeline *raw CSV → cleaned RDS → Quarto → PDF/HTML*. A fresh clone plus the raw inputs reproduces every table and figure without manual edits.
* 3. **Versioned R environment.** The repository ships an **`renv.lock`** and `build.sh` runs `renv::restore()` automatically. If the lockfile is missing, `R/00_load_libs.R` can install any missing packages when `INSTALL_MISSING=1` is set.
* 4. **Path-robust, fail-fast code.** Paths use `here::here()`. The pipeline checks required inputs and stops with clear messages if something is missing.
* 5. **Licensing & data access.** Code and lightweight derived data are in Git (MIT licence on release). Large/restricted datasets (e.g., EUROCONTROL snapshots) are excluded; the README documents how to obtain them under the correct terms.

**Transition.** With data-quality checks, clear exposure/outcome definitions, and a reproducible build in place, we proceed to the empirical results.

  ) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    pct_missing_flights = sprintf("%.1f %%", 100 * rows_missing_flights / n_rows),
    pct_missing_mortality = sprintf("%.1f %%", 100 * rows_missing_mortality / n_rows)
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(
    `Rows (panel)` = n_rows,
    Countries = n_countries_total,
    `Reference years` = n_target_dates,
    `Rows with flights` = rows_with_flights,
    `Rows missing flights` = rows_missing_flights,
    `% flight NA` = pct_missing_flights,
    `Rows with mortality` = rows_with_mortality,
    `Rows missing mortality` = rows_missing_mortality,
    `% mortality NA` = pct_missing_mortality
  )

knitr::kable(
  comp_tbl,
  caption = "Completeness of the analysis panel (Dec-2019 & Mar-2020 exposure × 2020–2023 mortality snapshots)."
)
```

Output confirms a fully balanced panel:

**Completeness.** All 25 EUROCONTROL states have flight-exposure and excess-mortality entries at each of the four reference years; no cells are missing.

## Exposure landscape (Dec 2019 & Mar 2020)

**Early exposure landscape.** Direct CN/HK flights funnelled into a handful of Western European gateways. @fig-top10_eu_dest_cntry shows **Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands** handling a majority of arrivals in December 2019 and retaining that lead after the March collapse. Those same hubs also drew from the **widest mix** of Chinese origins—**LHR 15**, **CDG 13**, **FRA 12** (@fig-origins_per_destination). Volume and diversity rose in lock-step (airport-level Spearman **ρ ≈ 0.86**; @fig-scatter_volume_vs_origin). **Liège (LGG)** sits above the trend—high origin diversity for ~200 rotations—because many S/N movements there are **cargo charters** (see [Limitations](#limitations)).

Together, the three plots show that both **how much** traffic and **how many** source cities concentrated in the same Western hubs, yielding a right-skewed exposure profile at country level.*

### Gateway concentration

Before the pandemic shock, direct CN/HK traffic into Europe was highly skewed. @fig-top10_eu_dest_cntry (Top-10 destination **countries**) shows **Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands** absorbing over half of all arrivals in December 2019 and still dominating after the [March 2020 cliff-edge](#march-cliff).

```{r fig-top10_eu_dest_cntry, out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Top-10 European destination countries for direct CN/HK IFR S/N flights in December 2019 (orange), March 2020 (blue), and combined (green). Bars are counts of filed IFR scheduled/charter movements (cargo-only F excluded)."}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/bar_top10_destinations.png")
```

**Take-away.** Import pressure was not evenly distributed: a few Western gateways carried most movements in both study months, producing a right-skewed country-level exposure index.

### Route diversity vs. volume

```{r fig-origins_per_destination, out.width="70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="How many distinct CN/HK origin airports fed each EUROCONTROL destination? Left: combined Dec-2019 + Mar-2020; right: month-by-month. Western megahubs (**LHR 15**, **CDG 13**, **FRA 12**) top the list. **Liège (LGG)** ranks high on diversity despite modest volume because many **N** flights are cargo charters—illustrating how movement counts can overstate **passenger** exposure at freight-biased airports."}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/bar_origins_per_destination.png")
```

**Volume and diversity move together.** Each additional ~100 flights is associated with **1–2** extra Chinese origin airports (**ρ ≈ 0.86; *p* < 0.001; *n* = 47**).

```{r fig-scatter_volume_vs_origin, out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Each dot is one destination airport. X: combined Dec-2019 + Mar-2020 S/N flights (log-scale). Y: number of distinct CN/HK origin airports. Spearman $\\rho \\approx 0.86$ (*p* < 0.001; *n* = 47). **LGG** lies above the trend—high diversity for moderate volume—because many flights are cargo charters."}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/scatter_volume_vs_origins.png")
```

**Interpretation.** The slope is driven by large passenger hubs in the upper-right; most other airports remain low-volume/low-diversity. **LGG** is freight-biased and inflates “exposure” without adding many travellers (see [Limitations](#limitations)).

### March 2020 cliff-edge {#march-cliff}

We **plot only the 21 states** with **≥ 5** direct CN/HK flights in Dec-2019 to avoid visually noisy −100% bars from trivial baselines (e.g., single charters). The correlation analysis uses the full **25-country** panel.

```{r fig-pct_change_filtered, out.width="80%", fig.cap="Percentage change in direct CN/HK S/N flights from Dec-2019 baseline to Mar-2020 for countries with ≥5 December flights (*n* = 21). All countries cut traffic by at least 50%; 7/21 reduced >90%, and 14/21 ≥75%. The Netherlands and Germany retained the largest residual shares; most others were near zero.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/pct_change_filtered.png")
```

**What the figure shows.** Among the **21 ≥ 5-flight countries**, every one cut traffic by **≥ 50%** by late March 2020:

* **7 of 21** slashed **> 90%** (bars pinned near −100%).
* **14 of 21** cut **≥ 75%** — a tightly synchronised shutdown.
* **The Netherlands and Germany** retained the largest **percentage** shares; several others, including **Belgium**, retained **lower percentage shares** but can still rank high in **absolute** counts.

**Data note (capacity vs movements).** The OAG figures cited elsewhere report **scheduled passenger seat capacity** only; **charter** operations and **all-cargo** flights are excluded. Accordingly, these series should be **interpreted as a capacity baseline**, not as counts of movements or passengers. [@warnocksmith2021]

With direct CN/HK traffic reduced to a trickle after late March, any variation in **first-wave** excess mortality must trace back to flights that arrived **before** the cliff-edge. The next subsection tests whether pre-collapse exposure leaves a statistical imprint in the **5 May 2020** snapshot.

**Reading the 2020 snapshot.** All four exposure metrics are **positively** associated with first-wave excess mortality (@tbl-spearman_2020). Three are statistically significant; the population-scaled metric is positive but not significant. Using the **Dec + Mar combined** count:

* Spearman $\rho = 0.526$ (95% CI **0.177–0.771**, *p* = 0.007; *n* = 25).
* Countries in the **top exposure quartile** recorded **≈ 465 excess deaths / million** more than those in the bottom quartile (median gap).
* @fig-scatter-2020 shows an overall positive slope with **notable vertical outliers** (e.g., **ESP** with high mortality despite fewer direct flights; **DEU** with lower mortality given its volume).

```{r quartile_gap, echo = FALSE}
snap20 <- corr_df |>
  dplyr::filter(target_date == as.Date("2020-05-05")) |>
  dplyr::arrange(total_inbound_flights_combined)

q <- quantile(snap20$total_inbound_flights_combined, probs = c(.25, .75))
gap <- with(
  snap20,
  median(excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million[total_inbound_flights_combined >= q[2]]) -
    median(excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million[total_inbound_flights_combined <= q[1]])
)

```

Spearman $\\rho \\approx 0.53$ (*p* < 0.01). Several Western hubs anchor the right tail; **ESP** is a high-mortality outlier at moderate exposure."}

## Evolution 2021–2023 {#evolution-2021-2023}

```{r fig-rho_caterpillar, fig.cap = "Spearman $\\rho$ (points) with 95% bootstrap CIs (bars) for Dec-2019, Mar-2020, and their sum. Estimates are positive in 2020. From 2021 onward they trend toward zero or below; in 2022 the Mar and Combined metrics are significantly negative. In 2023 they remain negative with CIs that touch or narrowly include zero.", fig.asp=0.6}
knitr::include_graphics("data/figures/rho_caterpillar.png")
```

**Pattern.** Estimates are **positive** in 2020, weaken toward **zero** in 2021, and turn **negative** in 2022–2023. For the **Combined** metric:

* **2020:** **ρ = 0.526** (95% CI 0.177–0.771; *p* = 0.007)
* **2021:** **ρ = −0.306** (95% CI −0.622–0.111; n.s.)
* **2022:** **ρ = −0.460** (95% CI −0.792 to −0.001; *p* ≈ 0.02)
* **2023:** **ρ = −0.419** (95% CI −0.749–0.045; **borderline**; CI grazes zero)

```{r tbl-sensitivity, echo=FALSE}
sens_tbl <- partial_by_year |>
  dplyr::select(year,
                `ρ baseline` = rho_baseline,
                `ρ adj age 65+` = rho_adj_age,
                `p adj` = p_adj_age) |>
  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3))

knitr::kable(
  sens_tbl,
  caption = "Sensitivity: baseline vs partial Spearman controlling for population ≥ 65 y."
)
```

**Sensitivity & partial checks.** Adjusting for the share aged ≥ 65 leaves effect sizes essentially unchanged (**|Δρ| ≤ 0.02**) and does not alter any year’s inference; age structure cannot explain the sign flip.

#### Vaccination coverage by exposure quartile (May 2022)

```{r tbl-vaccination_exposure_res, echo=FALSE}
vacc_exposure |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    `Exposure quartile` = paste0("Q", q),
    `Median full-vax %` = sprintf("%.1f %%", median_vacc),
    n = sprintf("n = %d", n)
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(`Exposure quartile`, `Median full-vax %`, n) |>
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Full-vaccination coverage on 5 May 2022 (±7 days) by flight-exposure quartile (baseline = Dec-2019 + Mar-2020 flights; OWID `people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred`)."
  )
```

**Gradient.** Median full-vaccination rises from **Q3 ≈ 62%** and **Q1 ≈ 69%** to **Q4 ≈ 78%** (*n* per quartile in table), consistent with wealth/governance gradients and the weakening/negative $\rho$ in 2021–2023.

## Results summary

* **2020:** heavier direct CN/HK exposure ↔ **higher** first-wave excess mortality (**ρ ≈ 0.53**).
* **2021:** association ≈ **zero**.
* **2022–2023:** association **negative** (significant in **2022**; **negative/borderline** in **2023**).
* **Population-scaled exposure** flips **earlier** (negative by **2021**).

# Discussion

## Interpreting the reversal (2021–2023)

* **Wealth & structural vulnerability.** Excess mortality tends to **fall with GDP per capita** and **rise with poverty/inequality**, which helps explain why the positive flight–mortality link **vanishes after 2020**: Europe’s most connected hubs (Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, France) also sit in the top-GDP tercile and had more protective structural factors. [@ioannidis2023]

* **Vaccination rollout.** By **5 May 2022** (±7 days), the **highest-exposure quartile (Q4)** had **higher full-vaccination** than lower-exposure quartiles (see @tbl-vaccination_exposure_res), aligning with OWID’s series and helping explain the **post-2020 attenuation/flip**. [@mathieu2021owidvaccinations]

* **Policy timing & capacity.** Comparative work shows **travel curbs mostly delay** spread unless paired with local measures. [@chinazzi2020] In Europe, the **slot-waiver** adopted in late March 2020 **removed the 80/20 “use-it-or-lose-it” incentive**, coinciding with a **drop in statistically abnormal low-load flights** documented for EU carriers. [@sun2022_a; @sun2022_b] Together with vaccination and governance-capacity gradients [@rahmanian2024], this helps rationalise the **2022–2023 sign-flip**.

## Strengths

* **Regulator-grade exposure.** **ADRR** captures **every filed IFR passenger movement touching European airspace**, avoiding known East Asia **ADS-B gaps** and origin/destination ambiguities. [@strohmeier2021]
* **Lean, transparent cleaning.** **S/N** only; exact re-files de-duplicated; scripts and derived tables alongside the manuscript. [@eurocontrol2022seg]
* **Reproducibility.** End-to-end R + Quarto with `build.sh` and `renv.lock`; **5,000-draw bootstrap CIs** for every Spearman $\rho$.

## Limitations {#limitations}

* **Load-factor bias.** Many EU carriers operated **statistically “abnormal” low-load** flights in **Mar–Apr 2020**, with shares receding through 2021; “abnormal” is defined **statistically** (IQR outliers vs 2017–2019 baselines), **not** by a fixed occupancy cut-off (e.g., *under 10% of seats filled*). Hence $F_{\text{SUM}}$ measures **potential seeding capacity**, not realised traveller volumes. [@sun2022_b] At a major hub like **Frankfurt**, passenger volumes collapsed while cargo shifted to freighters and “preighters.” [@fraport2021]
* **February gap.** No public **ADRR** slice for **Feb 2020** → peak early-exposure may be **under-estimated**.
* **Indirect legs invisible.** Multi-leg routings (e.g., **PVG → DXB → VIE**) and non-air links aren’t captured.
* **Ecological, small *n*.** A country-level panel (~25 units) can’t resolve within-state heterogeneity; residual confounding remains possible.

## Methodological reflections

The project was **initially envisioned** as a global effective-distance SIR exercise [@brockmann2013], but we did not proceed beyond scoping. Two constraints drove an early pivot: (i) sparse **East Asia ADS-B coverage** (and OpenSky’s flight-derivation quirks) [@strohmeier2021], and (ii) no **February** ADRR snapshot (public months are **Mar | Jun | Sep | Dec**). Given those constraints—and a BA time-box—we adopted an exploratory, fully reproducible **rank-correlation** design on **Dec 2019** and **Mar 2020** exposures against **four** annual excess-mortality snapshots.

## Implications & directions for future research

**What the results do say.** Direct CN/HK flight volumes help explain cross-country differences in **spring 2020** excess mortality.

**What they don’t say.** Ecological, rank-based associations do **not** identify causal effects or passenger-level transmission.

**Future work (beyond the scope of this study).**

1. **Passenger weighting.** Combine ADRR movements with IATA/OAG load factors to down-weight “ghost flights” and approximate imported passenger volumes.
2. **Multi-leg & multimodal import paths.** Reconstruct OD chains (air–air and air–land/sea) to capture indirect routes (e.g., PVG → DXB → VIE) and non-air entries.
3. **Sub-national resolution.** Build NUTS-2 or airport-catchment panels to reduce ecological bias and align exposure with local mortality.
4. **Integrated transmission models.** Embed exposure in network SEIR/SEnIR frameworks with NPIs, vaccination, and health-system capacity to move from association to mechanism.

## Conclusion

**Flight counts** are a useful proxy for **initial import pressure**: they **correlate with first-wave excess mortality** but **not** with later outcomes, which align more with **vaccination**, **policy timing**, and **system capacity**.

### Coverage audit — EUROCONTROL vs OpenSky

OpenSky’s community ADS-B coverage in early 2020 is uneven—**strong in Western Europe**, **thin over East Asia** and parts of **Eastern Europe** so it **undercounts** direct CN/HK arrivals relative to EUROCONTROL ADRR. In our audit, OpenSky **misses** five countries entirely and **undercounts** most others; we therefore treat OpenSky as a **QC benchmark only**. [@strohmeier2021]

```{r tbl-os-vs-eu-full, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  coverage_tbl,
  caption = "Direct CN/HK arrivals captured by EUROCONTROL ADRR (EU) vs OpenSky (OS). Rows sorted by ADRR Dec-2019 counts. OS reflects receiver coverage, not filed IFR (S/N passenger traffic only)."
)
```

### Absolute change in flights, Mar-2020 vs Dec-2019

```{r tbl-collapse, echo=FALSE}

  collapse_tbl |>
    dplyr::filter(`Dec 2019` >= 5) |>

  caption = "Absolute change in direct CN/HK → Europe-25 flights between Dec-2019 and Mar-2020 (countries with ≥5 December flights). Residual March totals highlight hubs that still handled ~200–350 rotations post-cliff."

### Vaccination by exposure quartile (May 2022)

Country membership of flight-exposure quartiles (baseline = **Dec-2019 + Mar-2020**; *n* = 25). Quartiles contain 6–7 countries.

```{r tbl-vaccination-quartiles, echo=FALSE}
exposure_base <- corr_df |>
  dplyr::select(iso3, total_inbound_flights_combined) |>
  dplyr::distinct()

exposure_q <- exposure_base |>
  dplyr::mutate(q = dplyr::ntile(total_inbound_flights_combined, 4))

exposure_q |>
  dplyr::group_by(q) |>
  dplyr::summarise(countries = paste(sort(iso3), collapse = ", "), .groups = "drop") |>
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = q, values_from = countries, names_prefix = "Q") |>
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("Q1 (low)", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4 (high)"),
    caption = "Country membership of flight-exposure quartiles (Dec-2019 + Mar-2020 baseline)."
  )
```

For the descriptive comparison in the Discussion, `people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred` was taken nearest to **5 May 2022 (±7 days)** for the same 25-country set (`01b_extract_vax.R` → `data/processed/vax_snapshot.{csv,rds}`). Vaccination figures are **not** used in any correlation/regression.*
