## Introduction

### Context & Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the speed at which infectious diseases can spread globally in a highly interconnected world. Aviation networks, in particular, played a crucial role in facilitating the international dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 during the early months of 2020. Previous studies demonstrated that long-haul flights drastically reduced effective distances between cities, accelerating the initial spread of the virus across continents [@chinazzi2020; @sun2022_a].

At the same time, countries exhibited substantial variation in excess mortality outcomes during the pandemic. Research has linked these differences to demographic, economic, and healthcare factors [@rahmanian2024; @matveeva2023]. However, the potential role of early exposure to international air travel—particularly its relationship to subsequent pandemic mortality—has received comparatively little attention in existing research.

This thesis investigates whether European countries that received higher volumes of direct inbound flights from China, Hong Kong, and Macao at the onset of the pandemic exhibited higher subsequent excess mortality. *Rather than implying causation, the analysis seeks to identify descriptive statistical patterns between early international flight exposure and mortality outcomes over time.*

### Research Question & Objectives

#### Research Question

> Does early exposure to international air traffic—measured by inbound flights from China, Hong Kong, and Macao—statistically correlate with higher excess mortality during the first pandemic wave in Europe?

#### Objectives

1. **Quantify early international flight exposure** of European countries based on aggregated inbound IFR air traffic from China, Hong Kong, and Macao in **December 2019 and March 2020** using EUROCONTROL data.

2. **Assess the association** between flight exposure rankings and cumulative excess mortality at four annual timepoints (05 May 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023).

3. **Critically reflect on the limitations** of air traffic–based exposure indicators and outline implications for future research.

### Thesis Outline

This thesis is structured as follows: Chapter 2 provides an overview of relevant literature on pandemic mobility, excess mortality, and methodological considerations. Chapter 3 outlines the analytical framework and data sources. Chapter 4 presents the results of the exploratory correlation analysis. Chapter 5 discusses the findings in the broader context of structural factors and methodological limitations. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes the thesis and suggests directions for future research.

## Literature Review

Recent comprehensive analyses (e.g. [@pizzato2024]) have highlighted substantial geographic disparities in European excess mortality and identified socioeconomic inequalities, healthcare capacity, and vaccination uptake as key drivers. This thesis complements such work by focusing specifically on early air connectivity as an additional, understudied dimension.

### Excess Mortality as Pandemic Indicator

### Network Epidemiology & Mobility-Based Seeding

### Prior Work on Air Travel & COVID-19 Spread

### Data & Methodological Considerations

Several studies investigating the spread of COVID-19 have used crowdsourced ADS-B flight data from the OpenSky Network to model mobility patterns and international virus transmission pathways [@strohmeier2021; @iacus2020]. OpenSky data offer broad accessibility and near-real-time coverage, making them a valuable resource for exploratory mobility analyses. However, these datasets are subject to significant limitations, particularly concerning geographic coverage gaps in regions with sparse receiver infrastructure. Previous research has highlighted the lack of reliable OpenSky coverage over Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macao—the primary source regions relevant to this thesis's research question [@iacus2020].

In the early conceptual phase of this thesis, OpenSky data were considered as a primary source for reconstructing early pandemic mobility patterns. However, preliminary analysis revealed substantial gaps in flight records for direct China-to-Europe connections during December 2019 and the early months of 2020. Many direct flights, particularly those departing from Chinese airports, were either missing or incomplete in the OpenSky dataset. Given these limitations, this thesis instead relied exclusively on verified Eurocontrol operational air traffic data, which provide comprehensive coverage of European airspace and flight operations. OpenSky data were used solely for illustrative purposes and to highlight known coverage deficiencies (see Appendix, Figure X).

## Analytical Framework & Correlation Method

### Data Sources & Preparation

This thesis combines a structured **origin–destination flight dataset** with an **observed excess mortality series**, harmonised at the country level for exploratory correlation analysis.

#### EUROCONTROL Air-Traffic Data [@eurocontrolData2025]

* **Temporal scope:**  
  - **December 2019** — the last full month before COVID-19 received global attention.  
  - **March 2020** — the onset of widespread lockdown measures across Europe.

* **Data filtering:**  
  1. Retain only flights marked as **ICAO type S** (scheduled) or **N** (non-scheduled commercial).  
  2. Select only flights whose **origin (ADEP)** is located in **Mainland China (CN), Hong Kong (HK), or Macao (MO)**, and whose **destination (ADES)** lies in a **EUROCONTROL member state**.  
  3. Use the **OurAirports dataset** [@ourairports2025] to match airport ICAO codes to **ISO‑2 country codes**.

* **Aggregation logic:**  
  Flights are aggregated by **destination country** for each reference month, yielding three exposure variables per country:

  \[
  \text{Flights\_Dec2019}_{i},\;
  \text{Flights\_Mar2020}_{i},\;
  \text{Flights\_Sum}_{i} = \text{Dec} + \text{Mar}
  \]

* **Deliverable:**  
  A harmonised country-level flight exposure table saved as `...`.

**Geographic Scope Justification**

Although Eurocontrol lists Israel, Morocco, and Iceland among its member states, these countries were excluded from this analysis due to the following reasons:

- Geographic detachment from mainland Europe, implying differing air corridor dynamics and reduced relevance to continental flight patterns.

- Iceland's accession occurred in 2025, outside the temporal scope of this thesis.

Accordingly, the analysis focuses exclusively on continental Eurocontrol member states with available and relevant flight and mortality data.

#### Excess Mortality Data (OWID → WMD + HMD–STMF) [@karlinsky2021; @owidExcess2024]

*Indicator used.* `excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million` — the cumulative
difference between reported all-cause deaths and an **expected baseline**
modelled as a linear extrapolation of 2015-2019 weekly trends.

*Why per million?*  
1. Enables cross-country comparison regardless of population size.  
2. Aligns with the flights-per-million robustness metric.

> **Data caveats.** Excess-mortality estimates inherit reporting delays and may
> capture non-COVID events (heatwaves, war). Ukraine is therefore excluded after
> 2021; country-specific caveats are listed in HMD STMF Metadata §3.

* **Harmonisation:** Mortality records are matched by **ISO-3** code to the flight-exposure table.  
  OWID population figures are retained for optional normalisation.

* **Reference dates & ISO calendar alignment:** Snapshots closest to **5 May**  
  (± 7 days) in **2020 – 2023**. Most weekly series follow ISO week 18, which
  typically includes 5 May.

* **Implementation:** Within each ± 7-day window the **closest non-missing value**
  is selected; choices are logged in `data_prep.R`.

* **Justification for using 5 May:**  
  – Comparable seasonal context (avoids winter-flu spikes).  
  – Ensures coverage for countries with monthly or delayed weekly reporting.  
  – Aligns 2023 snapshot with the **WHO** declaration ending the PHEIC [@who2023end].

*A full robustness check using weekly P-scores and flights-per-million ...

*Figure 4.5: Scatterplots for combined exposure.*

### Sensitivity Analyses

evaluate the robustness of the observed correlation patterns, additional sensitivity analyses:

- **Exclusion of small-population countries:**  
Countries with fewer than 2 million inhabitants excluded to assess potential distortion from small-country effects.

- **Exclusion of countries with incomplete mortality data:**  
Countries lacking complete excess mortality records for all four reference timepoints removed.

- **Normalization by population size:**  
Flight exposure indicators normalized by country population (in millions) to evaluate whether relative exposure, rather than absolute flight volume, influenced correlation outcomes.

- **Separate analysis by month:**  
Correlation analyses repeated separately for December 2019 and March 2020 to explore potential timing effects.

*Table 4.6: Sensitivity analysis results.*

The following chapter discusses these findings in the broader context of structural factors and methodological considerations

## Discussion

### Interpretation of Findings

[My discussion of the Spearman correlations, ranking, and visual insights.]

### Relation to Broader Structural Factors

[Now, how things like GDP, vaccination, age structure, or healthcare could interact.]

### Limitations 
[Likely needs more meat - might combine it with Methodological Reflections]

This thesis deliberately applies an exploratory, correlation-based approach to investigate potential associations between early international air connectivity and excess mortality. The following key limitations must be acknowledged:

- **No causal inference:** The observed correlations do not imply causation. Socioeconomic, demographic, and healthcare-related factors likely contributed substantially to mortality outcomes [@ioannidis2023; @pizzato2024].

- **Country-level aggregation:** National-level analysis may obscure subnational differences in both exposure and vulnerability.

- **Flight data uncertainty:** Exposure estimates are based on seat capacities rather than confirmed passengers. Volatile occupancy rates and ghost flights during early 2020 limit the accuracy of this metric. 

- **Eurocontrol data limitations:** The dataset also tracks ADEP and ADES that get communicated but not Shanghai -> Dubai -> Vienna. Which whould therefore count as Dubai -> Vienna. This could lead to undercounting of flights.

> While airports like Dubai or Doha were important global transfer points in February, this thesis focuses on **direct seeding from China** and **intra-European flows**. Modeling later pandemic phases or full global mobility networks exceeds the practical scope of this project.

- **Mortality data quality:** Excess mortality estimates vary in completeness across countries due to differences in death registration systems. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05522-2)


### Methodological Reflections

Early versions of this research design included dynamic modeling approaches such as a network-based SIR simulation [@brockmann2013] or SEIR extensions [@abou2020; @rozan2024]. However, incomplete flight records for January–February 2020, combined with uneven global data coverage and the practical time constraints of a Bachelor's thesis (~300 hours), rendered such approaches infeasible. A simplified, descriptive correlation analysis was chosen to maintain feasibility and transparency while stillallowing meaningful insights into early pandemic exposure patterns.
