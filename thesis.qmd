## Introduction

### Context & motivation

When SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019, the global airline network compressed inter-city travel times to hours, not weeks. Modelling studies show that long-haul flights shorten the “effective distance” between outbreak foci and distant populations, speeding the first wave of infections [@chinazzi2020; @sun2022_a].

Yet European countries later displayed wide gaps in excess mortality. 
Multi-country panels link those gaps to demography, health-system capacity, and **the timing/strictness of early NPIs** [@rahmanian2024]. 



### Research Question

> Among continental EUROCONTROL member states, is a higher volume of direct inbound flights from China/HongKong/Macao (Dec 2019 & Mar 2020) associated with higher cumulative excess mortality on 5 May 2020?

Snapshots for 2021-2023 are analysed as robustness checks.

### Objectives

**1. Measure exposure:** Create a country-level index of inbound IFR flights (Dec 2019, Mar 2020, sum) from EUROCONTROL data.

**2. Rank & correlate:** Compute Spearman ρ between exposure ranks and excess-mortality ranks on 5 May 2020; repeat for 2021-2023.

**3. Appraise validity:** Discuss strengths and limits of flight counts as a proxy for epidemic seeding.

### Road-map

- Chapter 2 reviews work on mobility-driven seeding and excess-mortality metrics.
- Chapter 3 details data cleaning and the correlation method.
- Chapter 4 presents exposure rankings, maps, and ρ results.
- Chapter 5 interprets the patterns, weighs confounders, and tests sensitivity.
- Chapter 6 summarises key findings and outlines next-step research.

## Literature Review {#litrev}

Recent syntheses—most recently @pizzato2024 map the socio-economic and vaccination gradients in Europe’s excess mortality, but they give scant attention to **importation pathways**. This thesis adds that early-mobility lens.

### Excess mortality as benchmark

Official Covid-19 death tallies are notoriously sensitive to testing capacity and certification rules.  
Analyzing 35 countries, **@kelly2021** contrasted reported Covid-19 deaths with excess-death estimates built on a *fixed 2020 population denominator* and found that the **residual-mortality rate** (excess minus reported Covid deaths) ranged from ≈ –175 to +115 per 100 000. The authors conclude that “published Covid-19 death data are **not directly comparable** across countries,” reinforcing the use of excess mortality—scaled to a single mid-year population—as the more robust yard-stick.

### Mobility-driven seeding


#### Role of long-haul aviation in January–February 2020 seeding

Using a global metapopulation model seeded with IATA/OAG passenger flows, **@chinazzi2020** estimated that the Wuhan travel ban of **23 Jan 2020** delayed epidemic growth inside China by only **3–5 days**, yet cut *international* exportations by **≈ 78 %** up to mid-February. Counter-factuals showed that even a **90 %** drop in air traffic would merely postpone, not prevent, global spread unless local transmission were halved. After the Wuhan shutdown, export risk shifted to other hubs—most notably **Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Kunming**—implying that Europe’s early exposure was driven by multiple Chinese airports, not Wuhan alone [@chinazzi2020].


### Air-traffic studies during COVID-19

The most relevant empirical and review work on aviation during COVID-19 is summarised in Table 1

| Study                  | Data                                             | Scope                           | Key insight                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

| **Warnock-Smith 2021** | OAG seats + Sabre MIDT revenue 2017-20           | China ↔ EU/Asia, China domestic | Domestic LCCs rebounded first; secondary China-EU links collapsed to < 2 % of 2017 revenue.                 |

*Table 1. Landmark air-traffic studies that inform this thesis*

Together, these studies establish that long-haul links seeded the virus early, while later traffic collapses and “ghost flights” distort raw flight counts—exactly the measurement caveat flagged in this thesis.

### Macro drivers of excess mortality {#macrodrivers}

Large comparative studies converge on three protective clusters: socio-economic advantage, resilient health systems, and fast-acting public-health measures.

**@pizzato2024** show that poverty and income inequality raise, while GDP-per-capita, health spending and vaccine coverage lower, age-standardised excess mortality in 29 European countries.  

Using latent-class mixed models for 21 high-income nations, **@rahmanian2024** find that *government effectiveness*, *early stringent NPIs*, and *higher full-vaccination coverage* jointly explain membership in the low-mortality cluster during 2020-21.  

**@matveeva2023** zoom in on the Delta era and confirm that late vaccine roll-out plus limited ICU capacity amplified deaths.  

All three studies, however, start the causal clock **after the virus had already seeded**.  
The present thesis steps one link earlier: did countries with heavier direct China/Hong Kong air traffic face a larger import shock that partly set these later trajectories?

These syntheses stop at **how countries coped once SARS-CoV-2 was inside their borders**.  
The present thesis pushes the causal chain one step back: *did differing levels of initial import pressure via direct China/Hong Kong flights help set those later trajectories?*

### Why EUROCONTROL, not OpenSky

OpenSky’s crowd-sourced ADS-B receivers leave blind spots across East Asia; many CN → EU flights in Dec-19 are simply absent (Appendix Fig X). EUROCONTROL, by contrast, records every IFR movement that crosses its network boundary. For this project the exposure metric is therefore realised flights (EUROCONTROL), not scheduled seats or partial ADS-B traces. OpenSky appears only to illustrate its coverage bias.

[TODO: Create Opensky map again...]

## Data & Methods {#methods}

The EUROCONTROL schedule includes traffic from mainland China (CN), Hong Kong (HK) and Macao (MO).
No Macao–Europe flights appear in December 2019 or March 2020, so subsequent figures refer effectively to CN + HK only. The acronym CN/HK/MO is retained for completeness the first time it is used; thereafter ‘CN/HK’ is shown on axes and captions.

To ensure comparability, excess mortality was measured on or near 5 May of each year (2020–2023), using the closest available OWID data within ±7 days. The use of May is justified both by the timing of the initial European epidemic wave (Spring 2020) and by the World Health Organization's declaration on 5 May 2023 officially ending COVID-19 as a global public health emergency [@who2023end].

This four-year series allows a consistent, annually repeated cross-sectional snapshot of excess mortality from the beginning through the official end of the pandemic.

### Study design

Exploratory, cross-sectional correlation at the *country* level.

Outcome = cumulative excess-deaths / million on 5 May of 2020-23.  

Exposure = direct CN/HK/MO → EUROCONTROL flights in Dec 2019 and Mar 2020.

### Flight-exposure data

Commercial passenger flights were extracted from EUROCONTROL's “Aviation Data Repository for Research”.  
The public archive publishes **only four sample months per year (Mar | Jun | Sep | Dec)**, so **February 2020—the crucial month between Wuhan lockdown and Europe's first local clusters—is unfortunately absent**. 

Filters: ICAO flight types *S* / *N*; **$ADEP ∈ {CN, HK}$ (all mainland-Chinese and Hong Kong airports); $ADES ∈$ the 26 continental member states.** *We therefore count flights from **every** CN/HK origin, mirroring the hub-substitution effect documented by @chinazzi2020*

> **Load-factor caveat.**  During March–April 2020 as many as **30–50 %** of EU departures were near-empty *“ghost” flights* flown mainly to keep airport slots [@sun2022_b]. Because EUROCONTROL records the movement but not the cabin load, our $F_{\text{DEC}}$ and $F_{\text{MAR}}$ metrics count a 3 %-full ghost leg exactly the same as a sold-out A350—so exposure is overstated wherever slot-retention flights dominated.


$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{\text{DEC}} &=\; \text{Flights in Dec 2019}\\
F_{\text{MAR}} &=\; \text{Flights in Mar 2020}\\
F_{\text{SUM}} &=\; F_{\text{DEC}} + F_{\text{MAR}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Flight exposure is intentionally fixed at these two pre-epidemic months to preserve temporal precedence.^[A time-varying flight metric (e.g. 2021 volumes) was not analysed because this study targets early seeding, not ongoing mobility. Future work could extend the panel with later exposure measures.]

### Excess mortality snapshots

*Source* OWID (WMD + HMD–STMF). 

*Reference date* closest non-NA within **± 7 days of 5 May**; Ukraine excluded after 2021 (data break due to war).

Rationale: The OWID excess-mortality dataset (a combination of WMD and HMD-STMF data sources) does not consistently provide daily observations for all countries. To maintain consistency across EUROCONTROL member countries, a pragmatic ±7-day window around each 5 May reference date was chosen to select the closest available observation. Countries lacking observations within this window—particularly Ukraine after 2021—were excluded from the corresponding yearly correlation analyses.

For every country and year we kept **only the OWID row whose date lay closest to 5 May (tolerance ± 7 days)**.  This pre-selection means that each country
contributes exactly one observation per year, so no further timing‐shift robustness test is necessary.


### Analytical variables

| Symbol | Definition | Transformation |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------- |


### Statistical approach

* Spearman $ρ$ between each flight metric and $E_t$.  
* 5000-sample bootstrap CIs. (Need a why here)
* Sensitivity checks:
  2. use $FPM$;
  3. drop countries with any missing $E$ snapshot

Analyses were performed in **R 4.4**; the full script and data pipeline are available in `notebooks/`.

As a simple confounder sanity-check we re-computed ρ for each year after controlling for the share of population aged ≥ 65 (partial Spearman). Adjusting for age changed ρ by < 0.02 in any year (see Table X in the Results), confirming that demographic structure is not driving the flight–mortality association. No other variables were added, as the study remains exploratory and correlation-focused

### Population denominator: validation and choice

Population denominators use the 2020 mid-year estimates from Our World in Data (OWID), which itself is based on the United Nations World Population Prospects (WPP 2024 revision). a fixed-denominator approach is standard in excess-mortality work [@karlinsky2021;
@kelly2021], who both scale 2020 deaths by each country’s mid-2020 population.

To confirm that dataset differences do not bias results, OWID’s 2020 snapshot was directly compared to the official UN WPP figures for all EUROCONTROL countries. For 38 of 41, differences were under 5% (median 2%). The largest outliers—Cyprus (–31%), Ukraine (–11%), North Macedonia (+11%)—were due to boundary or census changes in the OWID series. Re-running all correlations with the raw WPP figures shifted results by less than 0.01, so OWID populations were retained for internal consistency with the excess-mortality rates.

### Analysis workflow

1. **Define fixed exposure metrics**  
   $$F_{\mathrm{DEC}},\;F_{\mathrm{MAR}},\;
   F_{\mathrm{SUM}} = F_{\mathrm{DEC}} + F_{\mathrm{MAR}}$$
   (all measured once, in Dec 2019 & Mar 2020).

2. **Assemble annual outcome series**  
   $$E_t = \text{cumulative excess deaths / million on 5 May } t,
   \quad t \in \{2020,\,21,\,22,\,23\}.$$

3. **Main test**  
   Spearman rank correlation $ρ$ (two-tailed) for every $F_k \times E_t$ pair;  
   5 000-sample percentile bootstrap for 95 % CI (`boot` package).

4. **Sensitivity panel**

5. **Reproducibility**  
   Analyses in **R 4.4.0**; code and data pipeline in `notebooks/` (Git-tracked).

# Results

Countries in the **top quartile** of December + March flight exposure recorded **≈ 55 % higher excess mortality** than the bottom quartile (Spearman ρ ≈ 0.53, 95 % CI 0.18 – 0.80, *p* < 0.01). As shown in Table @tbl-spearman, the baseline ρ for 2020 is 0.53 with the same confidence interval.

Because every exposure metric is measured **before** the 5 May mortality snapshot, reverse causation (deaths → fewer flights) is implausible for December and largely mitigated for the March metric.

This chapter first describes flight-data coverage and early air-connectivity patterns, then ranks countries by exposure and presents the year-by-year correlation results. Where helpful, additional sensitivity analyses assess the robustness of those findings.

Countries in the **top quartile** of December + March flight exposure recorded **≈ 465 more excess deaths per million** than the bottom quartile in May 2020 (Spearman ρ = 0.526, 95 % CI 0.177 – 0.771, *p* = 0.007; Table @tbl-spearman).

Because all exposure measures precede the 5 May mortality snapshot, reverse causation is implausible for December and mitigated for March.

## Data coverages & descriptives

| Month | # flight (total)    | Median / country | Min-Max |
|----------|------------------|------------------|---------|

*Table 4.1: Descriptive statistics of inbound flight data.*

## Early air-connectivity patterns

> **Note on visual encoding:** All categorical colours follow the Okabe–Ito colour-universal palette (@okabe2002). The palette’s nine hues (hex `#009E73` green, `#E69F00` orange, `#56B4E9` blue, …) remain distinguishable for readers with the main forms of colour-vision deficiency. For continuous variables the viridis family is used. Axis titles, direct labels and dashed reference lines complement hue so that information is recoverable in greyscale printouts. No colours with strong cultural valence (e.g. “warning” red) are used in maps or flow diagrams in order to avoid unwanted emotional framing.



## Country exposure rankings

A ranking of European countries based on their total inbound flight exposure is presented.

- Separate ranking for **December 2019** and **March 2020**
- Combined ranking aggregating total exposure (December + March)

| Rank | ISO3 |Dec | Mar | Sum |
|------|------|----|-----|-----|

## Association with excess mortality

### Main correlation results

Table @... shows that the baseline **ρ between "combined" Dec & Mar 2019/20 flights and excess mortality on 5 May 2020 is 0.53 (95 % CI 0.18 – 0.80; p < 0.01)**.  
*Restricting the sample to the 25 countries that report a complete four-year excess-mortality series leaves the estimate virtually unchanged (ρ = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.18 – 0.77), confirming that missing-data exclusions do not drive the result.*

Figure @... plots ρ for all exposure metrics over 2020-2023; the association fades in 2021 and turns negative thereafter.

## Robustness check & sensitivity analyses

### Sensitivity Analyses

[TODO: evaluating the robustness of the observed correlation patterns, additional sensitivity analyses]

- **Exclusion of countries with incomplete mortality data:**  
Countries lacking complete excess mortality records for all four reference timepoints removed.

- **Normalization by population size:**  
Flight exposure indicators normalized by country population (in millions) to evaluate whether relative exposure, rather than absolute flight volume, influenced correlation outcomes.

- **Separate analysis by month:**  
Correlation analyses repeated separately for December 2019 and March 2020 to explore potential timing effects.

## Discussion

### Interpretation of Findings

Early international connectivity mattered—but only briefly.  
In 2020, countries in the top quartile of direct CN/HK flight exposure registered **≈ 55 % higher excess mortality** than the bottom quartile, and the rank-based association was moderate-to-strong (Spearman ρ = 0.526, 95 % CI 0.177 – 0.771, *p* = 0.007; Table @tbl-spearman).

The signal then **collapsed**: ρ fell to –0.306 in 2021 (CI –0.622 – 0.111, n.s.) and turned **significantly negative** in 2022 (ρ = –0.460, 95 % CI –0.792 – –0.001, *p* = 0.021) and remained negative in 2023 (ρ = –0.419, 95 % CI –0.749 – 0.045, *p* = 0.037).  

A one-shot confounder check (@confounder_test) showed that controlling for the share of population ≥ 65 y alters ρ by < 0.02 in any year, confirming that age structure is not driving the pattern.


[Here the Timeline Plot!]

### Relation to Broader Structural Factors

Several country-level attributes likely modulated the time-varying ρ pattern:

* **Wealth and health-system capacity.** Cross-country studies show that higher GDP per capita and stronger hospital capacity were associated with *lower* late-pandemic mortality [@ioannidis2023]. Because the most flight-connected countries are also among the wealthiest, these advantages plausibly explain part of the negative ρ observed after 2021.

* **Vaccination rollout.** OWID data show that by **5 May 2022** countries in the highest-exposure quartile had a median **≈ 78 %** of their populations fully vaccinated, compared with **≈ 62 %** in the lowest-exposure quartile—a **16-percentage-point lead** that likely suppressed late-wave mortality in the highly connected group and contributed to the sign-flip after 2021.

* **Policy timing & capacity.** Countries that paired **high government effectiveness** with **early, stringent domestic NPIs** clustered in the lowest excess-mortality group during 2020-21 [@rahmanian2024]. Consistent with **@sun2022_a** finding that stand-alone travel bans are blunt unless layered with vaccination and local measures, **and with @sun2022_b empirical result that slot-waiver timing quickly eliminated ghost flights**, our own pattern shows flight exposure mattered  only for the first wave; thereafter domestic defences dominated.

Taken together, **initial flight exposure shaped only the first wave**; once SARS-CoV-2 circulated locally, domestic resources and policy dominated the death toll. This helps explain why the mobility signal vanishes—and even inverts—after 2020.






### Limitations  

This study is deliberately exploratory and country-level; several caveats constrain interpretation.

#### Data limitations  

* **Ghost / abnormal flights (load-factor bias).**  “Slot-retention” flights peaked in Europe right after the first lockdown: Sun et al. detect **> 40 %  outliers** in April 2020 among major LCCs, clustered on dense Level-3 airport pairs such as AMS–BCN and ATH–MAD [@sun2022_b].  Because our exposure metric counts flight plans, not passengers, it over-weights these nearly empty sectors—and likewise any long-haul ghost service such as the high-fare, low-load **HKG–LHR** link documented by @warnocksmith2021.

* **Two-month window.** EUROCONTROL publishes only Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec snapshots; February 2020—the critical month between Wuhan lockdown and Europe’s first importations—is missing.  

* **Indirect routings.** Itineraries via third-country hubs (e.g. PVG → DXB → VIE) are not captured, so exposure is under-estimated for transfer states and over-estimated for direct-flight hubs.  

* **Excess-mortality uncertainty.** OWID’s WMD + HMD-STMF blend carries wide CIs; registration lags and baseline-fit choices vary by country [@karlinsky2021; @msemburi2023]. We mitigate timing noise by taking the nearest value within ±7 days of 5 May each year (see *01_excess_snapshots*). Yet, even with a common mid-2020 denominator, cross-country mis-classification persists: **@kelly2021** show no socio-economic pattern in residual-mortality rates, underscoring how heterogeneous death-certification practices still cloud international comparisons.

* **Population denominator.** OWID mid-2020 estimates differ from raw UN-WPP by < 5 % for 38 / 41 countries; switching to WPP shifts ρ by < 0.01, so OWID values are retained. (see: 04_population_qc)

#### Methodological limitations  

* **Ecological design & small N.** Results rest on ≈ 25 national aggregates; sub-national heterogeneity is hidden, and bootstrap CIs remain wide.  
* **No causal inference.** Temporal ordering reduces, but does not abolish, confounding: wealth, healthcare capacity, NPIs, and vaccination likely shaped mortality patterns [@ioannidis2023].  
* **Residual confounding.** Only one sanity-check control (age ≥ 65 y) was tested; GDP pc, vaccination coverage, or stringency indices could be explored in future work.

> **Bottom line.** Early direct flights plausibly seeded Europe’s first wave, but measurement error, ecological fallacy, and unmeasured confounders preclude strong causal claims about long-run border control effectiveness.








### Methodological Reflections

Early versions of this research design included dynamic modeling approaches such as a network-based SIR simulation [@brockmann2013] or SEIR extensions [@abou2020; @rozan2024]. However, incomplete flight records for January–February 2020, combined with uneven global data coverage and the practical time constraints of a Bachelor's thesis (~300 hours), rendered such approaches infeasible. A simplified, descriptive correlation analysis was chosen to maintain feasibility and transparency while stillallowing meaningful insights into early pandemic exposure patterns.

## Conclusion

### Key Findings

### Implications & Future Work

### Why Exploratory Work Matters
Although this thesis does not make causal claims, its findings demonstrate the value of transparent, reproducible exploratory analysis. When approached with methodological humility and critical awareness, even basic statistical patterns—such as the timing and structure of early international flight exposure—can yield insights into complex public health events. In a field often pressured by urgent narratives or overstated certainty, exploratory studies like this play a role in grounding interpretation and informing future research directions.
